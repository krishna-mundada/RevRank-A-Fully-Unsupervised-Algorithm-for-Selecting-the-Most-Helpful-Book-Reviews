(Actually I skimmed it a lot as it was so awful.)It was obviously written to be a third in a series for the movies. Divergent was bought for film in manuscript and Insurgent and Allegiant were written on the go-go afterwards. TO MAKE MONEY by being sold as a movie series. Divergent could end where it does. The movie Divergent can stand on its own.When elementary school children write stories they pull rabbits out of a hat as they need them in their stories. This is what Roth does. All of a sudden she's got a vaccine for the simulation serum or injection. And this goes on and on and on.There is a lot of Edward/Bella fanfic out there, most of it very poor and that's where this one belongs. Roth cannot imagine a future world as she has no literary background despite going to Northwestern and taking Creative Writing there. So there goes another well thought of university biting the dust along with Harvard and Yale. (After all if Dubya can get a degree from them, what are they worth?)Roth is a young woman who is over educated, way over educated, for her intellectual ability. To think that this is what a college graduate from a major university writes like, well, what do the graduates write like from other colleges? This is another Summit/Summit cash cow like Twilight and Hunger Games. They have someone decent cast and direct the first one, then they bring in new screenwriters and hack directors - read not artists - and continue on. They promote by trotting the stars all over the world like trick ponies to sell the first one and drum up the slow burn. It is cynical, contemptuous, and a &#34;rape&#34; of the readers and viewers after the first film. Neil Burger made a very good film with a very good screenplay. Lots of editing to clean up the book.

Well, my curiosity was finally satisfied, and I&#8217;m happy to say it was not at all what I was expecting.I also wasn&#8217;t expecting some of the twists & turns in Tris & Four&#8217;s relationship, but after Divergent it was clear that they&#8217;d always have their disagreements. I loved that because it makes their relationship seem more real. Relationships are not always easy, it&#8217;s not always flowers & picnics. People fight. Yes, the world as they know it is fracturing before they&#8217;re very eyes, and that is bound to put both of them on edge and make them more prone to fighting and disagreements.

A reader's hell, right?While I did pick this book up soon after its release, I didn't pick it up on the first day. I waited about a week. I lurk on a few message boards now and again, and during the week that I waited to get my hot little hands on Allegiant I happened to come across some posts regarding the book from other readers who showed even less patience than I. I read those posts even though they clearly stated they contained spoilers.Now, I'm not going to post any spoilers here, but I will tell you that the majority of readers on that message board were quite disappointed with Allegiant. They didn't like where Veronica Roth took the story. People were killed that the readers felt should not have been. They felt Veronica Roth had completely changed the character of Four/Tobias. And generally, they were just dissatisfied.For me, Divergent was a five star book. I loved every minute of it. Insurgent, not so much. I felt it should have been able to stand alone and that it just didn't stand up to the standard set by Divergent. I still liked it, but I didn't love it like I loved Divergent.Allegiant falls somewhere in between Divergent and Insurgent for me. I really liked it. And actually, the more I think about it - I do love it. Maybe just a little less than Divergent.Anticipation is a funny thing. On the one hand, I couldn't wait to get Allegiant and begin reading it. I read 61% of it the first night. But then I stopped reading it. I read the remainder in drips and drabs over a two week period. \"Abie, why on earth would you do that?\" you might ask.Because I am perverse. Because I had waited so long for this book and knew it was the last in the trilogy. Because I didn't want to get to the end.But now I have gotten to the end, and I must say I disagree wholeheartedly with the people on that message board. I didn't find Allegiant disappointing at all. In fact, I think Veronica Roth got it right. Life is hard. Even harder in a post-apocalyptic world like the one in this series. Tris and Four go through a lot in this book and tragedy can take a toll. People die - even people you don't want to die.

I love this series, but also found this one a bit of a heart break for me. I will try to write this review without spoiling any important plot points.First thing you will notice when reading this book is that it's from both Tris's/Tobias's perspectives. It took a little getting used to since the other books weren&#8217;t written in this manner. The story starts off exactly were the second left off. As the story moves along and they leave the compound the story hits a huge anticlimactic twist that was a bit disappointing at first, but I liked just fine as the story continued. Throughout this story it was nice to see how strong Tris became, especially compared to the second book. The ending of this story/series was just upsetting. I was truly upset and I shed a tear or 2 near the end. To me this is a testament the good writing and engrossing story of the series; because it was able evoke great sadness and also investment.Okay so still not giving away any plot twist but prepare yourself that many of your favorite characters from the first two books are not going to make it to the end of this book. Sadly a couple of my favorites did not. Their losses sometimes seemed to be for a good purpose, but others met a curious end. Some of my most hated characters made it through, but no one in this story makes it to the end unchanged or unaffected by the events of this story. I won't say anymore so I don't spoil the story for you.Finally I give this story 4 stars as I think that the story was good, but the end left some holes that should have been wrapped up. Also while fairytale endings are not always needed I liked the ending of the Hunger Games and something similar or even somewhat happy would have been nice here.

It leaves you with a book where you can't really empathize with the cardboard characters, and a plot that leaves you saying, &#34;Yeah, whatever.&#34;  I can forgive crappy plots when I am engaged emotionally with the characters. Sadly, I was not.I've seen a lot of other reviewers complain about the ending. I feel that was actually the strongest writing of the book. The middle just felt like a lot of filler to get to that end point. I suspect even Roth was bored for most of the book. It was when she let go of the convention of Chapter 1 Tris, Chapter 2 Tobias, Chapter 3 Tris...and just let the narrative flow from a single viewpoint for a while, that the prose was more compelling. It begs the question, is this a story that Roth WANTED to tell, or was it a novel Roth's publisher PUSHED her to tell because Trilogy=Box Office Capital? God forbid somebody in Hollywood tries to turn Allegiant into Parts 1 and 2 because there's barely enough compelling content there for a single story.", "reviewerName": "A.

I already feel like my time was wasted which is bad enough. The book read like a rough draft, at best. The story line was so confusing. It felt like one loooooong headache to read this book.First gripe: The back and forth narration by Tris and Tobias made no sense and totally confused me because they sounded the EXACT same. I had read a couple of the short stories from Four's perspective that have recently been released and really liked hearing Four's side of the story. With this, I felt like I got nothing out of the narrations. It was obviously done so the book could continue thru the whole story since crazy Ms. Roth killed off her narrator. But with both narrators doing the same thing all the time, I was completely confused.Second gripe: Descriptions of where characters were and what they were experiencing were totally glossed over. They travel to (or through?) The Fringe, and it was really tricky to understand the geography of, it's size, and even it's purpose, how it's governed and why it exists rather than just slummy parts of a city. No explanations and multiple visits there did nothing to enlighten me other than give a little background to where her mother came from.And that's another gripe: There was so much build up about Tris understanding her mother more, learning of her background and why she did what she did, and it was really for nothing. It never lead to a point or even provided a basis for Tris' reasoning. It was just an interesting activity for Tris to be engaged in. Had it been the thing that made the difference with David, or turned the tide because of what she learned, that would have meant something. This is one example of a storyline that just hung out in the air and then died because it went no where.I have more gripes but I've already spent enough of my valuable time on this book, not going to spend any more on this book or on the author's future books.

The Divergent Trilogy, a series that started off readable and declined through the second two books, simultaneously disappoints and satisfies me with Allegiant. Some threads conclude well, but the author makes some very stupid choices in her conclusion.In the third book it is revealed (SPOILERS) that Chicago is actually an experiment run by the government. The reason is that years ago the government messed with people's genes to try to make them better and so they are trying to cure the problem of damaged genes. I don't pretend to be an expert on genetics, but it's pretty clear that Veronica Roth did little research on how all this works. I rolled with it, though, but the genetic damage concept brings up some other problems too.To me, something felt a little bit off through Allegiant. Tris and Tobias are away from the action in Chicago and instead spend their days moping around at the research base. This series has come so far from its initial plot from Divergent, and I'm not sure how much I like the bigger story. The series was stronger when it was focused on the revolution in the factions, not this more complex scientific plot. Genetic damage is treated as something that creates a rift in the social classes, which is a cool storyline, but the author does not know how to effectively use it. Trips to a poorer society outside the research base are wasted potential, and when the author attempts to go for a plot with gray characters, things end up black and white by the end.A major issue with Allegiant comes from a storytelling perspective since the author decided to include both Tris and Tobias are narrators this time around. Unfortunately, both characters narrate identically and I frequently had to look back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was narrating. This was a poor decision, and I personally would have limited Tobias' perspective to the last few chapters when (again, MAJOR SPOILERS) Tris dies.So what did I like in Allegiant? Some secondary characters, such as Christina and Peter, are given good endings to their stories. Uriah's death was the most affecting of the series, and the final few chapters are easily the strongest parts of the book. Whereas Caleb annoyed the crap out of me in Insurgent, the exchanges between Tris and Caleb at the end are surprisingly well-done. While I'm not sure Tris HAD to die for the story, I didn't anger me like it did for others.Overall, some parts of Allegiant were stronger than others. It suffers from the same blunt storytelling the first two books in the series did and some potentially interesting ideas being particularly shallow.

{"reviewTime": "11 6, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Part 1: My Short History with Divergent:I guess you can call me a fan of the Divergent series though I&#8217;m not quite as enthusiastic about it. Each book has been engrossing enough to keep my attention through to the end so I guess that&#8217;s something. I only tried the series out as it was recommended as a good replacement for The Hunger Games. Its definitely no Hunger Games, not even close, but Veronica Roth managed to carve out something great while capitalizing on the success of The Hunger Games. Despite having read the first two, I really had little intention of buying Allegiant until it released as a cheaper, paperback copy. That is, of course, until the large amount of negative reviews started flooding into Amazon. As a result of these Amazon Warrior Whiners&#8217; actions, I accidentally had Allegiant&#8217;s ending spoiled for me by some reviewer who blurted out his dislikes without a spoiler warning. Wanting to know more about the ending and why people were so pissed off, I went and bought the ebook version of Allegiant. Here is my review.These following paragraphs will have no spoilers so feel free to read on if you want. I will put a spoiler warning when necessary.Part 2: My Review of Allegiant:I find the story to be just about as appealing as Divergent and Insurgent&#8217;s stories, or the little I remember of them anyway. I sold both copies soon after reading them. Having said that, it shares some misgivings with them as well. My big issue with this series seems to be the excessive, with emphasis on EXCESSIVE, use of love scenes between Four and Tris. Yeah, yeah I know they&#8217;re supposed to be dating and all, but really? Do we really need to read about them kissing every other page? Really? Maybe its cause I&#8217;m a guy and girls like this kind of stuff, I don&#8217;t know, but I find myself speed-reading through any passage that overdoes that crap.While first reading Divergent, I remember thinking that the idea of Factions and how each person in each faction was completely and totally committed to their way of life (being honest, being &#8216;dauntless&#8217;, being smart) was kind of stupid, unrealistic and totally against human nature, but Allegiant&#8217;s explanation for this was very, very cool.I&#8217;m no writing-virtuoso, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that some arguments between Tris and other passages in Allegiant  were &#8216;phoned in&#8217; and sloppily written. Take for instance this; nearing the final conflict, it is revealed that someone very close to Tris volunteered to take part in something extremely dangerous, and despite just being made aware of this fact, 5 minutes later she&#8217;s undressing and making sweet YA love with someone. That particular section seemed very rushed. These areas are few and far between. And as you have no doubt heard about already, Roth chose to write this book from two perspectives, Four&#8217;s and Tris&#8217;. It mostly works out great but I occasionally found myself unable to remember whose perspective I was reading from. This actually happened more than I would&#8217;ve liked, but story context usually resolves it so it isn&#8217;t really that big of an issue for me.As for the much talked about, infamous ending of the final book of Veronica Roth&#8217;s Divergent series goes, I loved it. The way that particular moment played out could have definitely been better written as it felt like too cliche a way to die, but everything that took place afterward was great.Part 3: SPOILER WARNING: The following paragraphs will contain major story spoilers:In case you completely skipped the above warning, these paragraphs WILL contain spoilers:Well, that important character to die was.... Tris. Like I said, I thought the way David killed her was just so extremely cheesy. Even though he has her at gun-point, she runs to input the code, is shot but enters the code, is shot again and then with the last of her strength, she is able to press the green button. Then we&#8217;re treated to a nice vision she has of her mother who takes her up to heaven and blah blah blah. It was just ultra lame. That&#8217;s about the only thing I disliked about the ending. As I already said, the rest was awesome and emotional. It was almost as if Roth was trying to make the reader let go of someone precious to them by killing off Tris. After all, we spent two entire books and a large part of Allegiant reading from Tris&#8217; perspective, and so we got to know her very personally, and to just have all of that snuffed out has got to suck and I guess some people just couldn&#8217;t handle it. Still though, this is one of the biggest fandom melt-downs I&#8217;ve ever seen.As for the complaints of Evelyn&#8217;s &#8216;sudden&#8217; change at the end after Tobias&#8217; ultimatum. I didn&#8217;t feel it was sudden at all and there were hints throughout the book that Evelyn cared more for Tobias than leading the Factionless. I thought her turn from Factionless leader to regular person was well-done.I honestly don&#8217;t understand why the ending has evoked such a giant negative response from fans.

{"reviewTime": "11 26, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "*** SPOILER ALERT***Allegiant, last book of the Divergent series, finishes the story of Tris and her friends as they try to save the experiment that is Chicago.Set in a post-apocalyptic version of the United States, Chicago has become an &#34;experiment&#34; city where the growth and perfecting of supposedly pure genes is falling apart due to inner turmoil and warring factions.I read a review before purchasing the book that expressed such disappointment and anger at the way the book ended. I stopped reading there as the rest of the review promised information I should read in the book and not in a review... I think that reviewer was disappointed because our heroine gives herself to save the people she loves. There is no happily ever after.Watching Catching Fire this weekend, and being an avid Hunger Games (books) fan, we saw the trailer for the Divergent. My husband commented that it looks like a Hunger Games knock-off, and in a way it is.Tris and Katniss share many of the same qualities, both books are placed after a war that ends the world as we know it, and both girls are heroines in their own rights. The similarities end there,Roth has created a different and wholly refreshing cast of characters who are truly developed and dimensional people. Unlike the Hunger Games, where the enemies are almost always enemies, Tris interacts with several people who are both good and bad. Roth does quite a lot to make this one of the main themes of the book; that we are, all of us, made up of both good and bad, and it's only the choices we make every day that make us evil or not.The prose of the Divergent series are also a tad more... prose-y than the Hunger Games. There are several paragraphs that are so beautifully written and express such emotion, particularly the parts that deal directly with Tris and her mother.I finished Allegiant last night, I cried when Tris gave herself for the greater good of her people. For me it was one of the most moving parts of the series and, though unexpected, not surprising as I learned to know Tris in the 1500+ pages of the three books together.That Tris is, like all 16 year old girls, and like all women, in need of her mother or missing her mother, was a theme in the book that resonated with me. That her mother comes to her in the end, and, well, here's what the book says:&#34;Am I done yet?&#34; I say, and I'm not sure if I actually say it or if I just think and she hears it.&#34;Yes,&#34; she says, her eyes bright with tears. &#34;My dear child, you've done so well&#34;.I suppose you can find any theme in any book if you look hard enough, but there is also a Jesus theme to this book. Tris painted as the savior of the world, a girl who is special, who doesn't quite fit anywhere, and who ultimately sacrifices herself.Anyway, I'd recommend the books to fans of the Hunger Games precisely because this is NOT the Hunger Games, but is written in a similar style and has a similar storyline. It's really not better or worse than the Hunger Games, just different than.

{"reviewTime": "11 2, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Hey Everyone, who's looking for an alternate ending?? Well check out Stephanie Ziel's alternate ending @ Addicted Readers: [...]Its was AMAZING!!! I wish Veronica Roth would of written an ending like that!!***UPDATED******REVIEW****ALLEGIANT, Oh, ALLEGIANT, how you failed me in so many ways!I went over every feeling, every thought, every emotion I had, be it good or bad. And after all that analyzing in my OWN opinion, I still came back with NOT being satisfied one bit with this Conclusion to my favorite series, or should I say \"Used To Be My Favorite Series\"?FIRST LET ME TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS ON THE ENDING:WARNING A BUNCH OF SPOILERS:***READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***|||||||VI had this book spoiled for me before I started reading ALLEGIANT, so I went into it already knowing what was going to happen to Tris in the ending. I found out about it 2 days before I started reading, and I was an emotional wreck! My husband thought I was insane! But I was stunned, I really could not believe Tris was going to die. I had no idea, not even a little thought that it would happen to Tris. So when I did find out, I was shocked! I was in denial for the first couple hours until finally I couldn't take it anymore and I broke down and read some of the reviews! Then, I was FORCED to see the truth, Tris would in fact die!! UGH, I still get teary eyed when I think about it! I never would of thought Veronica would do that to Tris, and not just to Tris, but to her LOYAL FANS! Tris had so many near death experiences, especially in INSURGENT, when she battled with death, and wanting to die, but finally she had an eye opener and realized she did not want to die, and that she was more then a self sacficer. So that led me to believe Tris had all the near death experiences that she was going to have, boy was I wrong!!!I stand 100% behind MY Opinion, that this WAS THE WRONG WAY TO END THE DIVERGENT SERIES!!!AGAIN, MY OPINION!!!Veronica said that she had this ending planed from the very beginning of this series, and that it was the ONLY ending that she felt would do this series any justice! WHAT, NO, WRONG VERONICA! She said she felt having these characters end with a happy ending, holding hands, walking off into the sunset was fake and unbelievable. BUT wait, I came across an alternate ending to ALLEGIANT written by a Fan Fiction author Stephanie Ziel (POST HERE), and let me tell you, IT WAS AMAZING!!! And, NO, they did not have this sugarcoated happy ending like Veronica didn't want! They had a hard ending, that brought tears to my eyes, but still TRIS SURRIVED!!! And IN MY OPINION it was the BEST ENDING FOR THIS SERIES!!! If Veronica would of wrote this ending I think A LOT more people would of been more satisfied, including me!!Now, all that said, I was still very upset that Tris died. I thought it was the wrong move for Veronica to make. (I am NOT the only one who thought this, as of the date of this review, Amazon's has a 2.8 Rating, Not good, not good at all). BUT I wasn't just upset that Tris died, I didn't like the WAY Tris died! I thought Tris sacrificing herself and taking her brothers place in the Weapons Lab, was the worst way for Tris to go! I mean I get it, this book is about selflessness and forgiving, and all that blah, blah, blah, BUT if Veronica Roth was going to kill off the main protagonist she should of at least had her go out with a bang, in which she DEFINITELY did not!THESE ARE THE MANY OTHER REASONS I DID NOT LIKE ALLEGIANT:Okay, the ending was not my only problem with ALLEGIANT. My first issue was the alternate POV's. I HATED IT!! It irritated me to no end! UGH, it drove me insane!! I could not tell Tobias and Tris apart to save my life. Only way I was able to tell them apart was when I went back to the beginning chapter and read the heading of who's POV it was. If not for the heading with the name of who's chapter it was, I would of been lost and waiting until whoever POV it was, said the other persons name. But their voice was so similar, that at times I just wanted to put the book down and scream, yes it was that bad for me!!Another issue I had was Tobias! He was a totally different character from the first 2 books. I mean a different guy all together! ONE of the MANY reasons I LOVED Four was that he always had this sexy mysterious way about him, that just kept me wanting to know him more. And when I read he's POV in the Short Stories, I was in awe! I loved the tough, strong-willed, determined, guarded Four. And being in his mind was really such a treat! He had all these character traits that I loved so much in the Short Stories. So I was expecting to have the same in ALLEGIANT, but of course with more emotion because in the short stories he wasn't with Tris or in love. So I was curious to see how Four would react to being in love and having someone else to worry about besides himself. BUT WOW, what I got was A BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT!!!At times Four acted nave, like he was new too their world and all the plotting, scheming, betrayals, and death around him. It caused him many problems that he couldn't get out of! UGH, and he was WAY to trusting with the first pretty girl that feed him a load of crap! Since when did Tobias become so trusting with complete strangers that he was willing to go against everything he believed in? Not the Tobias I have grown to love and care deeply for!Another thing that changed in ALLEGIANT with the character traits, was that Tris became the strong, sure of herself girl, and Four was the weak, trusting and unsure of who and where he belonged guy. And that was not the Four I've come to love! Nope, this new and NOT improved Four in ALLEGIANT --SPOILER-- was so trusting, that it even cost Uriah his life!! I'm not saying it was directly Four's fault, because it wasn't. But if he would of trusted Tris and her judgment, and not trusted Nita, and went along with her insane plan, then the whole mission would of had to wait, then Uriah wouldn't of been standing where he was when it all happened! So again, if Four would of went with his heart instead of his quick impulse, then certain things wouldn't of happened. Which honestly, I felt some thing's happened with really no reasoning behind it. Like Uriah, what was the whole purpose of killing him off??? Really I would love to know, because I can't figure it out. Again, he was another one of my favorite characters that got killed off, FOR WHAT???? Four was just so annoying, and most of the time I couldn't' wait to get back to Tris's POV. But even Tris had her annoying chapters too! I felt the total opposite about all of this in the first 2 books! I LOVED pretty much everything about DIVERGENT & INSURGENT! But ALLLEGIANT just fell flat for me in SO MANY WAYS, so more reasons then what I'm putting in this review!!! If I listed all the reasons why I hated ALLEGIANT, then we would be here all day, because their is SO many! Seriously!Then the plot was so annoying, the whole what was outside of the fence was stupid, and definitely not what I was expecting! (I say that NOT in a good way) The GD's and GP's, was the worst idea Veronica has ever came up with! I was expecting something so unique and original from Veronica, because that's all she's ever given me! I kept waiting for the big BANG to happen when they went behind the boundaries of their city. I was hoping for a drawn out scary reason for them being horded off and locked away like dogs! But the whole Gene thing was just laughable! When I first found out the reasoning behind everything, I was just staring at the book, saying \"What Did I Just Read? This Can Not Be It? Their HAS TO BE MORE\"? I kept waiting for it all to be a big hoax's, but it wasn't, and I was let down for the hundredth time with this book! I just couldn't take it anymore. Then by the time I got to the ending, I just didn't have it in me to be mad, or upset, or cry anymore! I've had enough letdowns to last me a bookish lifetime just in this one book! And its SO HEARTBREAKING to feel this way about my favorite series!!!I honestly can not think of one thing that I liked about this book! As of the beginning of this review I was planning on giving this book 2 stars, but now that I voiced some, NOT even ALL of my issues on paper, I realized that their really wasn't anything I enjoyed in this last book! So I feel obligated to give this book 1 star! And oh, how that makes me feel terrible! I really, really, really, wanted to love this book! I did, I really did, but I just can't for all the reasons stated above, and more not stated! I can't stress enough how much I LOVED the first 2 books, DIVERGENT & INSURGENT, and I had such high hopes for ALLEGIANT, maybe too high, because I was let down HARD!! I just can't love this book, or even like it, and I can't give it more then a 1 star rating! And I've never given a 1 star rating, NEVER! At least until this book! SO it is really hard for me to give it this 1 star, but it really does deserve it, in MY OPINION!ON A FINAL NOTE:So, I will walk away from this series heartbroken, torn,lost, and unsure if I should ever put as much hope, faith and trust in another author the way I put forth in Veronica Roth! Will I read more of her books? I really don't know! She is such a skilled writer, that just took a big dive down in ALLEGIANT, but that does NOT make her any less of an author in my opinion. So I would hope Veronica would make ALLEGIANT a learning experience and learn from the many mistakes she made in this last book, and not make them again. So as of right now, who knows, depends on if I will ever feel inclined to pick up a book with Veronica Roth's name on the cover!So there you have it, what I hated the most about ALLEGIANT! What are you thoughts on ALLEGIANT?? Did you love it, hate it, didn't really care either way?? But for all of you who feel that ending was the last straw with ALLEGIANT, then please take a moment and check out this alternate ending I have on my blog, as it has definitely made me feel so much better and more complete to walk away from this series with brighter thoughts!", "reviewerName": "Alicia", "summary": "Who wants an ALTERNATE ENDING????

Do they already think she is so accomplished at this point that they don't need to read her work?  I don't know what the problem was, but the writing is really amateurish and sub-par... if this had been the first book, there would be , no accolades, no hysteria... no movie.The jumping back and forth between the viewpoints of Tris and Four is contrived.  I think Veronica got the idea to do it based on fan response to the way that she re-wrote some of the chapters from Four's viewpoint... but writing is all about decisions... the writers decisions... perhaps she is too young to realize that whimsical notions don't become classics.  I kept having to look back to see who was talking... the difference in viewpoint was not dramatic and served to be confusing rather than fresh, entertaining or insightful.I think there is a natural point in the book where she might have chosen to show Four's view of things -- and that could have been a better choice.Good writers take us on journeys that are not always happy, don't always end the way the want, etc.  This journey sometimes inspires hope, answers all our questions, and then sometimes it just doesn't... but in that case, a good writer has given you enough to consider that the story stays with you... you find yourself working out what happened... thinking over what the author was trying to say.  The journey \"sticks with you\" long after you finish reading.  The issue here is that there is no point of view; there is no message.  We may have been expecting that, but at the end of the day, the divergent series was a journey to nowhere... and that is why we are disappointed.I hope Veronica is surrounded by people that tell her the truth about this story.

First, it gets dropped from a 3 to a 2 because I found myself skipping through some parts that felt unnecessarily drawn out. The book was good as I was reading it and it has a lot of romantic and exciting moments between Four and Tris that I loved but the whole series was ruined by the ending. Honestly, I had such high hopes for this finale and it could have ended so many different ways but this ending left me wanting so much more. Disappointment is the main reaction I am having and that sucks more than the feeling you get when you want to keep reading despite the novel ending but by the last couple chapters I was left... empty. It felt like all my hopes were built up for this amazing unknown exciting conclusion and then they just left me wishing and hoping that the ending wouldn't be left that way. I don't (won't) give spoilers but I just wish it had ended differently. I'm known for giving most books 5 stars and great reviews but with a pit in my stomach I just... can't. I wish I could take some Abnegation serum and forget the ending of this book. When I finished I kept thinking I should've stopped after Insurgent.

{"reviewTime": "10 24, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "The final book in a trilogy is always going to be the most scrutinized, especially when it is the finale to a series that has been as beloved as Divergent.  As this is one of my very favorite stories, and some of my most beloved characters, I was anticipating this book more than any other this year.  I felt fully invested in what was going to happen and told myself that no matter what, I was going to trust Veronica Roth's vision.When I was thinking the other day about series endings, I actually found it hard to come up with ones that I felt were really and truly bad.  Why?  Because they're not my books and I think an author can end them however they see fit.  Roth was always up front in interviews that she's known how the series was going to end from day one and she laid the groundwork for that calculated ending right from the first page.  So, now that I'm seeing some quite vicious reviews of Allegiant, I would encourage readers to 1) absolutely not post spoilers in reviews so the ending isn't ruined for others and 2) to remember that the only person who knows the fate of this world is the author.  If you're not happy with it, that's why God invented fanfiction.My biggest question going into Allegiant was this -  what's on the other side of the fence?  Roth gives us the full, detailed explanation fairly early on.  It was similar to what I was thinking/hoping, albeit more complicated and planned out.  It was a good combination of psychological and scientific and felt in line with the rest of the world we'd been given.  The reader learns some interesting information about the history of the US and also about Tris' mother, Natalie.  What Tris and crew learn about what's beyond the walls of the city ultimately sets the final conflict into motion.  Roth, as she has over the entire series, brings up some very difficult questions and themes.  I found myself pondering things like how society divides itself, nature vs. nurture, how we manipulate each other for both good and bad, why we make sacrifices, trust in others and in ourselves, science and taking knowledge too far, etc etc etc.  Even though Allegiant is a very long book, I felt like Roth covered a lot of ground in a small space.  Everything - plot lines, characters, symbols - felt purposeful.  I'm finding it hard to believe there are readers who think Roth didn't know what she was doing because, despite some small missteps, the choices she made as a writer were quite calculated.In terms of things I wasn't pleased with, they were minor.  The world-building has been a complaint with readers and while it's never bothered me before, I did feel like there's a bit of an info dump in the first half when Roth explains what's been going on outside the walls.  Not sure how else she could have done it though, so there's that.  Also, the chapters alternate POV's between Tris and Tobias.  I think this was absolutely necessary to get the full picture of what was happening.  But, especially at the beginning, the voices did not feel as distinct as they might have.The best part in my experience with this series has been the relationship between Tris and Tobias, as well as their individual journeys.  In Insurgent, Tris was the neurotic mess and Tobias called her out on it.  In Allegiant, Tobias is the basket case, which was so fascinating for me to read.  I'm such a psychology person and seeing how Tobias' worldview changed as new information was added completely reeled me in.  I think that Allegiant, like Insurgent, is also a grief book, but in a different way.  Tris was dealing with the death of her parents, and now Tobias, and everyone else, is dealing with the loss of an idea, a lifestyle.  And sometimes the consequences of that are even greater.  I loved seeing Tobias come to terms with the changes in his life, trying to reconcile his feelings about his parents, and the choices he made because of those things.  I've always felt that the romance was realistic - actual people have arguments and work through then, shocking! - and appreciated that although the setting was extraordinary, the conversations and feelings and hiccups along the way for Tris and Tobias were not.And then there's the ending.  If I think about the actions of the characters throughout the series, who they are as people, what they value and what they've overcome, the choices Roth made in how to conclude this novel are not surprising at all.  I understand that lots of readers are feeling entitled and upset about those choices, but not me.  I am but one reviewer, but it all makes total sense in my mind and I applaud Veronica Roth for being brave and doing what she knew was right.  After all, she's the author.4.5/5 for Allegiant, a huge 5/5 for the whole series.A gigantic thank you to Veronica Roth for giving me what has been one of the best reading experiences.

{"reviewTime": "06 26, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I'm not even sure where to start. I love reading. I love it. I look hard for books that I really enjoy and when I find a series I enjoy, I can reread them again and again, still enjoying them as much or more each time. I read the Harry Potter series ~10 times. I read the Ender series ~3 times. I read Hunger Games series ~4 times. I understand the necessity sometimes in killing off important characters, whether to make the story more real, more believable, or to portray some kind of moral lesson, or whatever. I get that. I'm used to reading books that have parts that make me cry.This book is different.First of all, I LOVED Divergent. The story was so awesome, I want to read more and more of that world. Then Insurgent, such a tough book! So much action, I was on the edge of my seat and tense for basically the ENTIRE book. A book has never been so gripping for me, and I've read a lot. I was thoroughly impressed.Then came Allegiant...I was disappointed in the story at first. When they go outside of the city and figure out the truth of everything. I felt let down, like it was too ordinary or forced. Like, &#34;This is it? This is the big secret?&#34; Then the fact that she switched chapters between Tris and Tobias. She made them so similar that I had to keep checking the chapter title to see who I was reading about. And that was disappointing. Before this book, I liked Tobias a lot more. He was unique. Showing his thoughts just made him practically identical to Tris, but also showed his incredibly stupid judgment, which I felt didn't add anything good to the book. It just made me disappointed in a character I had revered before.But I liked the world she had created, and I loved the characters anyway from reading the first two books, and I felt that she would end the series strong, as the entire story so far had been, minus the &#34;outside world&#34; letdown had been so strong and unique.*****SPOILERS******But then, she just made the ending stupid. I've honestly never cried so long and hard for a book, nor have I been so disappointed, depressed, and betrayed. You don't kill the heroine. I've read her reasons why she did it in interviews. Because of the theme of selflessness and self-discovery and how Tris finally &#34;knows who she is.&#34; and you know what? I think that she could have accomplished the same lesson if she had let Tris live. Tris did sacrifice herself for her brother out of love. She did go through the death serum. She nearly died. But she didn't have to actually die. The sacrifice element was already there. She already created the scenario. Tris made her choice. That was the important part. And I thought it was stupid. Just when she finally valued her life, and realized the right reasons for being selfless, she was just going to die? After all of that self discovery and all that she had been through? All she had done and learned and seen? Just die?I've NEVER felt this way about a book series before. Good job, Veronica Roth, you made the series memorable and you certainly stuck out. I'll never read this series or anything by her again. Because I know that after I get committed to a story and their characters, there will be a blow like that one, and it's really not worth it for me. I know some people think it's cool that she had the courage to write that and she doesn't care about her readers, just her story...whatever. I didn't take away anything good from that ending. I don't think it was a good ending for Tris either. She was a strong character, dying was an out in the story, wasn't it? That's why Peter wanted to take the memory serum, why Tris had wanted to die so much in earlier books, why Caleb volunteered for the task. Tris didn't go for it as an out, but that's all it became, just some painful stupid ending that ruined the entire series.", "reviewerName": "alongtheivy", "summary": "Loved the first two books, now I hate the entire series", "helpful": [5, 5], "overall": 1.0, "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewerID": "A83HHJXEW1BGZ"}

Secondly, I didn't like how the book was written from both Tris and Tobias's POVs. Not because I don't love Tobias, because I do, but because the voice of the characters in each of their sections were too similar. They were so similar that I actually forgot who's POV I was reading sometimes. At time I would think I was reading Tris when actually I was reading from Tobias's POV, or vice versa. The author should have made the character voices more distinctive. I also didn't like the ending, but that is a personal thing in that I prefer happy endings to my series.I also thought the action wasn't nearly as good as it was in the first two books. Yes, there were action scenes but they just couldn't compare with the first and second book. Nothing like an initiate stabbing another initiate in the eye with a butter knife, lets put it that way. And lastly, I didn't enjoy the &#34;poor me&#34; moments in the book. Both Tris and Tobias had part of the book where they were all angst-y and feeling sorry for themselves. Normally I don't mind a bit of angst from characters in the books I read, but it just didn't gel with the characters as they were portrayed in the first two books (in my opinion anyway).So yes, read this book so you can complete the trilogy and know the way it ends.

Also the way it made the characters feel so small in a world that was clearly larger than what they were taught.  Overall I did enjoy the book, it was another one that I could not put down.

Same with the second book. By the third book I was committed to the story and the characters. I fell in love with Tobias and enjoyed the sexual tension between he and Tris. Tris was a frustrating character to deal with but I loved her bravery and strength. I love all she had to offer Tobias, her friends and her society. So, I loved the book until the ending...........then I became sad, devastated, depressed and I cried a lot. I could not escape the sense of grief and loss. It felt too real. I'm wondering if it would have been different if I had not read them back to back.I think the ending could have been different. To have the reader so heavily invested in the love and success of this important relationship then to throw us off the cliff at the end is callous, and shows no regard for the audience; an audience invested in happy endings. I think Roth is an immature writer who impulsively spat in the face of her readers by destroying our sense of hope and love. To say Tris had to die is nonsense.  To have us experience Four's pain of losing her is just sadistic. I don't need to spend my hard earned money on this crap. I know it's fiction but a good story sometimes strips us bare perhaps because it taps into a vulnerable place we have tucked safely away.

This is why I fell in love with the Divergent series.  It&#8217;s set in a world that I can comprehend, but in a time far away.  It has characters that are complex, but relatable.  It was truly a wonderful experience to follow Tris through her world.  To literally lose track of time.  The best part of any trilogy is the fact that, as a reader, you can continue to experience the world that the characters live in even after the first part of their story ends.  I hate when a story ends and you have to say goodbye to the characters.  This is why I was so excited that shortly after I discovered the first book in the series (and promptly devoured it&#8230;as well as the second) I learned of the third.  Now, I waited to purchase Allegiant until I knew I would have time to devote to it.  I knew if it was anything like the first two, I would be reading nonstop to the end.  I spent two days of stolen moments with Tris, Tobias and all the new developments of the world outside the fence.  There were periods of heart-pounding (and I do mean that literally, chapters 48&49) excitement, but also too much time spent on tertiary, one dimensional characters.  I think I can agree with other reviewers when they say that the back and forth narration was a bit confusing.  In the first two novels Tris and Tobias had such distinct voices, this one fell short.  I had a hard time distinguishing them and neither character grew past what I had already experienced.  In fact, in my opinion, Tobias took a huge step back and Tris finally succeeded in becoming a martyr.I read recently that Veronica Roth felt that the death of Tris was a natural progression of the character; she had escaped death so many times before, she could not do it again.  I have to respectfully disagree.  The reason dystopian stories are so wonderful is that the impossible is possible! After the chapter where Tris gets shot, I continued on in disbelief, comforted by the fact that she would be alright, she would find Tobias again, and they would survive the tyranny they worked so hard to overcome.  Imagine my utter disappointment when she actually dies&#8230;I was devastated.  She escaped the Death Serum, something no other character, apparently, could do&#8230;and then dies because she is shot&#8230;lame. Perhaps my expectations were too high or misplaced.

The tone of both their spoken dialogue as well as their unspoken thoughts felt much colder than the previous two books.

There is also a decent amount of bad.The good: The development of the characters continues here. We see Tobias (Four) start to fall apart a bit under the pressure. He's not dealing well with the world they find outside the wall, or the continued conflict inside it. I know a lot of people don't like this breakdown his character has, how much of a change it is from the other books, but I still feel like it's a definite realistic portrayal of someone being put under that kind of stress. Not many people do well with such things.The world outside the wall is interesting, if a bit cliche in places. The overall plot about why the cities exist is also interesting, though it requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief. Still, none of this bothered me. It's dystopian fiction. Suspension of disbelief comes with the territory.The ending...I commend the author for being so ballsy and making it stick. That's all I'm going to say on that. Love her or hate her or it, it was one heck of an ending and true to the characters. I'm not going to talk about the ending because it really can't be done without spoilers, but I felt it gave us further insight into a lot of the main characters and was very well done.The bad: The switching points of view. Ugh. What on earth made her decide to add this to the final book? I often found myself having to check whose viewpoint I was in, at various points of the book because it was hard to keep straight at times. I really didn't like that. At times things dragged, and it felt like various aspects of the outside were shown just to go 'hey look how bad the bad guys are'.

I feel like everyone thinks it should have just been a nice happy little ending like we all wanted, but we all need to just put aside our own feelings for a moment and look at it from her side. She was teaching us about LIFE. And how life isn't always fair. Kudos to Veronica Roth for doing it. We all needed that.

But I don't feel like any of those things are true. I feel like those are all things from people who didn't get what they wanted and are just bitter.There's not denying that Veronica Roth is a wonderful writer. One of the best. She's created something that millions of people have opened their hearts and book selves to. And that's something special. The choices and decisions she made when writing Allegaint are really brave and while Allegaint didn't leave me happy and singing songs about love, I feel like Allegiant has made it's mark on me and I won't be forgetting it any time soon (or ever).Allegiant gets right to the point, right away, from page one. And it doesn't slow down until the end.I really liked the pace.Of course the characters are great. If your reading this review, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you've already read the other two books in the series.Roth makes a lot of big moves before page 100. Moves I haven't seen from a writer since J.K Rowling. Roth and Rowling are almost two of the same.I feel like Roth really has created a world that is believable and realistic. In the real world, not all the good guys are going to make it. No matter how much you love someone, they can still die.I like how Roth really explored what happened in the past that created the world that up this series. We get to learn a lot more about what led up to the Fractions and what happened to the US.The one thing I didn't like was the scientific reason behind why people are Divergent. I think what really appealed to a lot of people about this series is how anyone can be Divergent. How anyone can be brave, smart, honest, and selfless. But the reasoning that being Divergent is just in your DNA, it kinda messes up the whole concept of the series, in my opinion.Overall, I feel like this is a really good ending to this series. I still feel a little shell shocked from the whole book (I read the whole thing in 24 hours. And it has 526 pages). One of the things that proves that a work of fiction is great (to me) is when, at some point, it makes me cry.If it can bring that out of me, it means it made an impact one me. And Allegiant made an impact on me, more then once.All I can say is, you might not like the ending of this series or you might like it.

{"reviewTime": "03 2, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Nearly everyone I&#8217;ve talked with who have read the Divergent series has complained about how awful Allegiant is.  They say that Divergent was amazing, but Insurgent and Allegiant spiraled into a meaningless mess of chaos.  (Okay, maybe not in so many words, but you get the idea.)Well, I&#8217;m going to break that mold.I liked the book.Simple as that.  I didn&#8217;t LOVE it, but I didn&#8217;t HATE it.  It was definitely a slower read than the first two, but that&#8217;s all right.  Sometimes, a slow read is better &#8211; the reader has more time to absorb the author&#8217;s intended feeling and message for the book.  In fact, in some very minute ways, I liked Allegiant better than Divergent.  For instance, maybe I was just desensitized to it by now in the series, but it seemed to have less touching/kissing in it overall.  Perhaps the protagonist just wasn&#8217;t as terrified by the aspect of a relationship, so she wasn&#8217;t hypersensitive to the touching; therefore it was written in a more natural way for readers.  Maybe; that&#8217;s just a theory.One thing that I did really appreciate about Allegiant was the setting.  Finally, Roth was breaking out of the &#8220;the city&#8221; setting and showing us more of the world.  While reading Divergent and Insurgent, I consistently had a nagging feeling of claustrophobia.  It was just so unnatural for the setting to be focused in one city, and for that city to be the only place ever talked about.  I don&#8217;t mind reading books that are set in only one city, but at least the author mentions that it is part of a country; there are other cities nearby, other countries in the world, etc.  In Divergent and Insurgent, it was just &#8220;the city.&#8221;  This bothered me, so I was very relieved when I read Allegiant, and finally it broke out of the city, expanded its setting, and answered all my questions.  I also realized that Roth had intended to give the feeling of claustrophobia to readers in the first two books &#8211; which she definitely accomplished.  As a writer myself, I can&#8217;t help but smile at how she manipulated my reading experience.  Well done, Ms. Roth.I&#8217;ve also heard people mentioning that they hated the ending, and they cried for days after finishing the book.Not me.I felt like the ending was satisfactory.  No, it was not a happily-ever-after, but it was realistic.  Realism is missing from so many stories nowadays; the ending to Allegiant was actually refreshing, in a way.  They had gone through so much &#8211; flirted with death so often &#8211; that someone had to die.  It wouldn&#8217;t be realistic if no one had.  I also believe that Roth chose the right character to die &#8211; if it had been anyone else, the impact wouldn&#8217;t have been there, and I believe the effect left by the death was good &#8211; healthy, even.  In life, people die.  People suffer.  People move on, slowly but surely.  It was sad, yet real.  I appreciate that.All in all, the Divergent Series was good.  I have a few bones to pick with each book &#8211; a few things I don&#8217;t care for in each &#8211; but overall, I like the story and the characters.

After we get outside the fence and enter the world of the future US with it's genetics war, etc. there is too much glossing over.  There is no depth to these story lines and the characters change to quickly as others have said.The ending could have been fixed so easily.  Yes, Tris could have taken her brothers place and gotten shot.  Great.  Realistic!  Why couldn't she have spared us the Shauna story line and just made it Tris'?

{"reviewTime": "10 24, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Here is the perfect recipe to ruin a trilogy, an upcoming movie and possibly you entire carrer:1. Write Divegent: make your readers fall in love with your characters, add mistery to the romance, make a skinny girl tough and strong.2. Write Insurgent: Make the girl a little depressed and edgy, make her reckless and unstable, add some fights to the romance. Make your readers want to slap the protagonist in the face for so many bad choices. Fix it all at the end thanks to the guy and its never-ending forgiveness.3. Write Allegiant: Lose the interest in your own story, stop caring if you are developing a good book, just worry about senseless \"impact\" no matter what, lose you mind and be willing to lose your readers. Then close your eyes and type meaningless sentences without stopping to see what you've done.SPOILERS AHEAD!!Veronica Roth impressed me at first. Such a young author! she created the first two books that are far from being perfect but I got to care and felt fond to the characters. I love the misterious Tobias, never knowing what he really thought and always seeing him be the strongest, most reliable one. After Insurgent I thought we were done with the bad decisions and that the non-developing relationship of Tris and Tobias would finally go somewhere. After their last lines in Insurgent, when the trust was back, I thought that we were now going to see serious development in characters and in the romance... Alligent was extremely desappointing at this and every other single level, and did not bring the so-needed closure and sense to this repetitive story (how many times have they go through revolution and secret agendas?).So many things went wrong! 1)The two POV's were absolutely confusing, there was not difference between Tris' and Tobias' language or way of thinking. I got lost so many times in which one was narrating. Instead of either preserving the Mistery about Tobias or actually discovering a brilliant mind, we only saw Tobias as an extension of Tris's mind. 2)Divergence, actually ment nothing! for two books we got to believe that being Divergent ment that you were special, and that you had some power or skill that made you unique. Now it just means nothing,it didn't even made a difference when Tobias was no longer in that category. 3)Peter was unnecessarily pushed into the book for nor reason. his character never brought anything to the story, just dead weight. 4) Tobias turns into a 12 year old, yelling at everyone and making all the bad decision as possible. At least in Insurgent he had a good motive. But in Alligent he is driven only by his pride and desperation. Not the Four we all know and love.But by far, the worst thing of all is the senseless, unnecessary and very predictable dead of Tris. By the time I realized that this book had 2 POV's it was obvious that Tris would not survive. Ms. Roth, how could you kill your main character when half of your book was and is still in need of conclusion? Tris got to die only to add shock value to the book but it was done in a bad way. It made the full trilogy meaningless and absurd. Real impact would have been that Caleb was the actual unselfish one and at the end decided to do the right thing (Remember Prim Everdeen??). Tris should have survived so all the loses and gains were worth it. Let her live through it and make a real statement of reallity and mending each other, so we had the chance to actually see the story conclude with an actual character and romance development. (Just as Moking Jay did at the very end). And after Tris got killed in the most unoriginal  way (gunshots?? Really?? after surviving death serum?) we are left to see Tobias struggle and suffer and never recovering from his lost. This was heartbreaking and painfull. We don't want to see our beloved characters suffer for no reason and with no sight of hope.And as if this was not enough, Tobias, our brave, strong, misterious, reliable Four, became a politician??!! You have to be kidding me!! the thing he and Tris hated the most? the same as Marcus? this was absolutely ridiculous!Ms. Roth, you tried to make the story real, but instead you made so many unrealistic turns (unrealistic to the characters)and so many absurd outcomes that I have lost my entire faith in this trilogy and in any future book written by you for that matter. We already have enough tragedy in the real world, no need to bring that to our faces in a book. And certanly not in this way! You could have done a great final book, a remarcable one. One that we would never forget, but instead decided to go exactly the other way and now me and other readers will spend our energy in trying to forget this tragic, horrible and insensate ending.

Veronica Roth tied up all the ends and gave me something that I wanted to know, but....The ending felt like it was forced to quickly. That everyone had to make super quick decisions. Tobias was pushed to figure out what parent. Tris was pushed to save her brother or a corrupt city. Caleb had to chose to let Tris go. Evelyn had to decide whether to lose her memory or make peace. Marcus had to decide on peace. All of that felt forced somehow and I couldn't put my finger on it. Everything else made since. Why they chose to go back to the city, why Tris died, why Tobias didn't fall apart, etc.This book was a great book. It did leave me feeling depressed and like part of me will never be the same again, because I was hoping for spectacular ending, where Tobias and Tris end up married with kids. But, not all authors are gonna give you that, and that's what makes me love Veronica Roth. She didn't give me what was expected. She gave me the unexpected! Just like Tobias and Tris did. I wanted Caleb to die, but she chose to not be selfish. She chose her life over her brother's because she forgave him. That was the ultimate sacrifice! Caleb dying would have been easy because she would forget all the anger and hatred she felt about him, which wouldn't have solved anything. By dying, to me, she told him, &#34;I love you. Live and be brave because you have given me more than I need. We are all messed up people and even you handing me over to death was not the worst thing you could have done. I chose to let you die.See? I messed up to.&#34; She finally knew what forgiveness was, and that made her Tris.Tobias was the one I wanted a little more grief out of, but Tobias is hard and strong. He doesn't show grief in the way I envisioned. He went and done what he had to do, only to be told the love of his life was dead. He doesn't break down or go crazy. He stood still and remembered all the things he could about her. And even when he goes to see her, he still doesn't lose it. True Tobias fashion. You see a broke man, but not on the outside. It did open him up a little bit more. And what really got me, was when he went zip lining. He conquered a fear for her. Not entirely, but he did it for her. He became free. He sacrificed himself to show he wasn't selfish.All in all, I have never laughed, cried, gotten angry and more with any other series. This one captured from the beginning to the end. I just wish the characters didn't feel as forced to make decisions so quickly. The books taught me to love with your whole heart and make your own choices. It taught me to be brave, selfless, honest, smart and kind, because there is no way I can be just one. Becoming who you are is what I learned and took away from it, along with the rest I said. Veronica Roth, I applaud you for taking deep leaps and doing something extraordinary with this book.

The reviews were already flaming, which should have been a red flag.There are many, many reasons why this gets only one star. The first as to be the POV switching. I know many have already stated it, but often I had to check who the POV was to understand what was happenig. Tris and Four read as the EXACT SAME PERSON. Who let this happen? The editors, Roth , the publishing execs? Seriously it read like some self published junk not a professionally distributed novel.This leads into the second problem: The desolation of Four.There have been times when a characters actions make me go &#34;why did they do that?&#34; this for the first time actually made me think we were being tricked and Four was under a simulation/drug hallucination. Until the bombing that injure Uriah occurs. Then I truly thought Four was going to have his memory wiped or be left by Tris. Because that amount of idiocy convinced me he had been brain damaged in fsome previous scene we didnt read. No again, no to everything, a guy who supposedly only has four fears and can lead/teach others now has crippling inadequacy issues, is shamefully cowardly in owning up to his mistakes, and is obsessed with his parents. Complete character meltdown.Which tacks onto the character meltdown of Tris. Previously a slightly violent, but selfless girl who is pretty sharp is turned into a psychological genius able to discern other character's flaws and abilities almost omnipotently. Still action oriented,but now so much so that she almost reads like a brainwashed operative. Where did all the conscious and humanity of Tris go? Apparently the same place Four's bravery and intelligence went.To be honest this book was very hard to finish because I flipped between irritation and downright boredom so much.I am trying to write this sans spoilers which is hard because the plot holes and inconsistencies are a huge part of the one star rating. Also these are the problems NOT counting the ending. It gets a one star review because by the time I got to the ending I just didnt care about the characters anymore. In fact the ending to Tris' story was fine by me, the character was already gone by the 65% anyways.Which leads me to the ending. The first time I read it I actually thought it was a joke. Really, I foolishly thought there was going to be a super epilogue and we would find out it was all part of Four's fearscape or something. Wrong,wrong, wrong Allegiant goes out with something an author, who is obviously still very immature, considers &#34;shocking&#34;. Think Shonda Rhimes shocking but with almost no emotion, and absolutely no purpose. Instead I daresay the &#34;shocking&#34; part makes another huge plothole, and makes the main character entirely useless to the plot of the story.Finally what really bothers me about this last book is that any sort of value, or meaning that could be taught by reading this trilogy is completely thrown out the widow.

She didn't choose the agreeable 'Amity' ending of hearts and flowers and a future of baking cookies that some readers may have wanted for their favorite characters.Roth was brave. She chose a thought-provoking ending. She loved her characters enough to be true to what drives them.I've had a small problem with the earlier books, even though I loved them. People, in general, are not one-dimensional. In 'Divergent' and 'Insurgent,' other than divergent people, you didn't see many people showing traits outside of their chosen faction. What on Earth is wrong with these people?In 'Allegiant,' I appreciated the reasons for what led these people to become so one-dimensional in the first place. Things finally made sense. I often wondered where Ms. Roth was going with all of this. This book is tightly written and better edited than the previous works. And don't get me wrong, those books were great. This was just better, and more purposeful. There didn't seem to be a wasted word in the entire book.I think those who were shocked today to read the ending will later find themselves thinking and re-thinking this series.

{"reviewTime": "10 26, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I feel like I have to start this review with a quick note...I know that a lot of people disliked this book, but I think it's mainly because they're upset at the ending. That's fine that you didn't like the ending because it's now how you thought, but please don't bash Ms. Roth, who is an amazing author. She has complete creative license to do whatever she wants. She can kill off whomever she wants, and write the story how she sees fit. And if this ending was how she imagined this series ending, then it's good enough for me. Was I upset at the ending, yes. Any rational person would be. I cried and cried, and then cried some more. I literally couldn't believe what just happened. But I also expected it in some ways (which I'll get to later in this review). So overall, I don't care if you complain about the ending, but just stop bashing Ms. Roth because there's a HUGE difference, at least to me, between bashing a book and bashing an author.Anyway, I personally thought this book was fantastic. There were a couple of things that I really didn't like, which is why if I could, I would give this 4.5 stars. However, overall, I greatly enjoyed it, and am very sad that this series is over. Let's start with the dual POV first. I loved being able to read from Tobias's perspective (but seriously, who wouldn't). I honestly wanted to read more from his POV then Tris's. Ms. Roth did a very good job at showing us the real Tobias, who is completely separate from Four. He's not as strong as he would have the world believe. Tobias is suffering and unsure. This glimpse into his true character made the book so much more enjoyable for me, and his character much more realistic. War changes people, and I for one am grateful for the inside look. Tris is struggling just as much in some ways. However, she is stronger, and ready to take on whatever may come her way. She thinks things through, but at times acts rashly. Her character was also very realistic to me, and while I didn't like her POV as much as the previous two novels (which I think was largely because of Tobias's being in this story as well), it was still a great look into her mind.This leads me to one of the things that I didn't like. I thought the dual POV was very poorly done. At first, I could easily tell the difference between Tris and Tobias's POV's. However, as the story progressed, it got harder and harder to tell who was actually talking. I found myself going back to the beginning to double check who was supposed to be talking because the voices sounded similar. Usually, you could tell who was who just by the setting that character was in, but when Tris and Tobias are in the same setting, it just got downright confusing. Dual POV is hard to pull off, but I was expecting a bit more from Ms. Roth on this front because I do think she is a great author that has an amazing talent.Next up is the setting and plot. I will agree that this was one of the weaker aspects of this book, however it wasn't that weak. Granted, I didn't enjoy this book as much as the other two, but this is also a completely different book revolving around completely different terms. Chicago is changing after Jeanine's death and Evelyn's rise to power, and this isn't necessarily a good thing. This is a very fast-paced book, but there were times where it was lagging. These parts easily could have been cut out, and the story wouldn't have suffered in the slightest. At the same time, I flew through this book. I wanted to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next. The circumstances are different in this book, and I think Ms. Roth did an excellent job at pulling everything together. All our questions are answered except one (at least in my mind). We find why this all happened (and why there were factions), we find out about Edith Prior and Tris's mom, we find out what it actually means to be Divergent. Basically, we find out the truth. I know that some people really disliked this portion of the book, but honestly, I feel that what Ms. Roth did made a lot of sense.  I think another reason I liked where Ms. Roth took this book is because it speaks to the science person in me. Being a Biology major in college, this whole thing just clicked with me in a way. I don't feel that in anyway was this a cop-out. While it could have been a little bit better researched in some aspects, it still was a interesting and creative direction to take the story.Now onto the ending. First let me talk about this \"sex\" scene. I interpreted it as they did have sex. I'm not putting this under spoiler because you can go into any review already and find this out. However, it was confusing as heck by what she meant. I guess it's really up to the reader to interpret what they want, but this part of the book could have been done a whole lot better. This also goes for the romance in the book. I know that Ms. Roth put it in to appease readers (especially because of what happens at the end), but I thought a lot of times the romance was out of place, and just didn't fit very well. In my opinion, there was actually too much. The climax of this book blows you away. There's no way to lessen the blow or anything. You will cry and sob and think it's unfair. Should you not read this book solely because of this reason, no. You need to read the book. But just know that the ending will literally shred your heart to little itty bitty pieces, and you'll need at least a 2-3 day recovery period. This being said, I actually completely expected something like this to happen. Never once in this series has it been sunshine and rainbows, and to expect the ending of this book to change anything is silly. This book is about a war, and in war there are many many casualties. Sometimes people who you don't want to die, end up dying, while the people that you can't stand live long and happy lives. But again, this is exactly what happens in war.Ultimately, I thought this book was great, and even though it wasn't as good as the previous two, I still thought it was an amazing end to this series. The title could have been better (I mean I even was coming up with other titles for this book while reading), but don't let other reviews hinder you from enjoying this novel. My best advice is go into this book with an open mind. Don't expect everything to work out perfectly and remember the world that this series takes place in. Our world isn't perfect, so you can' expect the ending to work out perfectly.

Right next to Harry Potter and the Hunger Games. I would tell my friends that it could quite possibly be my favorite because i absolutely loved the first 2 books but it depended on the ending, because lets face it, the ending is what makes or breaks the series.With that being said, i felt a roller coaster of emotions. I had been anxiously waiting for the final book to come out for months and was a little let down. the story didnt have as much action and fighting as the first two books did and it got really repetitive and extended in some parts. it had things that could have been left out and some things felt forced in.The ending is obviously the part that everyone is going to talk about. i was heartbroken that Roth had killed Tris. I had grown attached to the character and thought that she was going to get her happy ever after. Yes, i understand that its the type of book where stuff like this happens, but after reading some other reviews, i have to agree where it may not be the fact that Tris died but the manner. She was all up for Caleb sacrificing his life but then at the last second she doesn't because she knows he doesn't want to. it really gave me a sour taste with the story because i had thought she had gotten over the stupid sacrifice thing for Tobias. I felt like she didn't consider even for a split second about him until it was too late. And i agree with some other reviewers, if you are going to kill off your main character, then you should do it in a manner that honors them and leads peace and resolution. Tris's death pretty much only honored Caleb's cowardicy and there was no resolution. and what's worse, her killer, David and the other guards, doesn't even get punished for it.I guess I had hoped/expected Tobias and Tris to survive and get their happy ending because they had been through so much in the first two books. as i was reading it, i knew something big was going to happen because it had been calm up until then but what i thought was Tobias's memory was going to get wiped/reset and he wouldn't remember her. The more i think about it the more i wish that that was the ending. b/c it still would have had that surprise tragedy but at the same time it has hope for the future that they could end up together again.Overall, i can't say i hated the book. because i didnt. i'm not going to boycott the series just because i did agree with the story. being an English major in college it kind of made me more open-minded and accepting. I know that i will reread the series again in the future, but i'll probably stop reading it in the last scene that Tobias and Tris are together and they say they love each other (at least for a little while). I'm not going to boycott the movies because i think the movies are going to be fun to watch and i have a funny feeling that they are probably going to change the ending to Allegiant's movie (especially after seeing the fan backlash)", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "summary": "Not the book i was expecting...(SPOILERS)", "helpful": [3, 4], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1382572800, "reviewerID": "A1T7UACHT46KAY"}

The fractionless who follow Evelyn and the Allegiant who are in search of the truth and what is really outside the fence.

After discovering everything they have ever known was a lie and now faces a different kind of destruction they must make difficult choices and show true bravery to save their families and their world.This book did not go in the direction I expected and I would just like to give a big thank you to Veronica Roth for that. What an amazing finish to an amazing series. In keeping true to the values and morals she created in her characters this was a truly amazing end. I can see how people would be upset about this final book because it does stray from the typical conclusion that we are used to from this kind of book. However, that is what makes it such an amazing read. As always Veronica Roth draws you into the world she created with her fantastic characters and descriptive writing. Once again you get drawn into the relationship between Tris and Four and how they are able to navigate their relationship when the world around them is falling apart. We are finally told what it really means to be divergent and how that makes them different from everyone else and why the fractions played such an important part in their society.This was a fantastic book and I definitely recommend reading it.

Besides the last Twilight book, several of the other series' final books range from 2% to 5%. Not bad, means the author did a great job in closing the book up.  The Twilight final was 18% (ouch).  This damn book, 24% of all the reviews are 1-Star reviews.  Compare this to under 2% for the first two books of this series and I can comfortably say Summit Entertainment has a big problem on their hands. The 24% doesn't cover the 2-Stars either.

One being the \"dual narrative\".  I have to agree with many of the other frustrated readers of this third book.  Both Tris' and Tobias' chapters which are intended to be of their own perspectives sound the same! I am not just talking about the sentence structure and all that.

I loved this!I've loved this series since I first tore through Divergent, and I really felt the last book in this trilogy did not disappoint.I love the turn this book took and the explanation as to what is outside the fence. I had my own theories too, but I like how the changes forced some of the characters to evolve. Four is no longer the bad-ass he was in the first two novels... but that is ok! It's more realistic to me. All of the crap everyone has gone through... I think some of the twists that made people mad are some of the things that made the story more believable, to me. In a dystopian novel, the ones I love the most are those that seem somehow realistic and like something that could actually happen. All of the GD/GP things... hello, things like trying to create the perfect race HAS HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE! The events in this book were not that much of a stretch for me.End rant.In  Allegiant, the characters you've come to love are all there, yet things have changed so drastically the things that used to  be so important to them, like factions, aren't anymore.

I don't want to give too much away and spoil it for anyone.I'll end with this- I love reading trilogies, and some trilogies leave a lot to be desired by the time the last book in the series comes around. This is not one of those books. The story does not fizzle away, it is not a stereotypical fairy tale ending, yet all of the loose ends are tied up.

Divergent was a pretty good read, even if there was a lot of suspension of disbelief employed. Insurgent was even more far-fetched and left me very confused and not entirely sure that I wanted to finish the series, but I was slightly curious about how this all might be resolved.I just finished Allegiant this morning and am disheartened and very disappointed by this book. My first complaint comes in the form of the dual narrative. I would often forget who was narrating at any given point and get confused by why they were saying what they were saying. I didn't get it straight until the book was almost finished. I think that there were more clever ways to solve this problem.Also, the solution as to why the people are in the city in the first place is ridiculous. It doesn't line up with real science at all. In fact, why wouldn't they just gas the fringe population with memory serum to make them forget why they're so upset? The technology used is very unbelievable. You could get away with this kind of writing, perhaps, in a middle book, but not in the finale.* Spoiler Alert*Does anyone else have a problem with the fact that a 16 year-old-minor, who is supposed to be the heroine and is perhaps a role-model to other young girls reading the book, has sex with an 18 year old boy? I say boy, because he is not a man and if he was a man he would have respected her body and probably would have held to his Abnegation upbringing a bit more in this area, since it governed his most basic thought and action patterns throughout the books. Do we really need to be encouraging more young girls to be having sex out of wedlock? I think that Tris and Tobias' romance would have been just fine without the escalating sexual encounters. I didn't add to the story and if anything it led to further discrediting, because I'm pretty sure that Tris would have cared about what her parents thought about her actions, since she kept trying to right by them.*Spoiler*The &#34;solution&#34; to the problem of using memory serum on the bureau was beyond belief. Aside from the obvious fact that they didn't even try to think of any more reasonable solutions, there was the fact that these people don't exist in a bubble. The Bureau workers most likely don't live in the complex and probably have families and records kept that would contradict everything they were being re-educated on.

The reason for the lower star on this book was mostly for the POV changing each chapter.  If you listen to it on audible, it was actually much better because the girl and boy voice switch as the Tris/Tobias POV switch.  But when I finished it on my kindle, I constantly had to go back and say \"who am I right now?\" cause 2 pages into the chapter I forgot which POV I was in.  Very confusing. Even just left justifying and bolding the name instead of blending it into the chapter # would have been better.Though I'm not sure that would have helped  because the tones and the descriptions (like commenting on other people and their actions) were so similar, you really couldn't tell which head you were in.I liked the idea of getting Tobias' POV, I just wish it had been done better...The book was slow to start with but it kept me entertained the rest of the way. The pace was pretty good, the different \"cities\" and the plot there was fine but there was enough for a fourth book if Ms. Roth would have been given the time to do it.Although I felt like Tris became a better person, I felt like Tobias became weaker and weaker as the books went on, which was sad for me. I adored the strong Four leader he was.The ending wasn't great but it wasn't as terrible as others seem to think.  It was realistic and one of the better written sections.

My excitement soon turned to disappointment as I continued to read. How could this author take a story so promising and turn it to utter crap?!***May Contain Spoilers***I really disliked the shared POV Ms. Roth used between Tris and Tobias. There were often times I had to look back at the beginning of the chapter to see who's POV it was being told from. The personalities of Tris and Tobias were totally watered down to the point I couldn't tell which one was narrating a given chapter. Every other chapter is alternated between being told by Tris and Tobias. A good writer does not need to tell you who's POV the story is being told from, at times I felt like I was reading a bad fanfiction.The plot was substandard. I liked how the other two books addressed the dissidence between the factions, and how Tris was breaking that mold, by not taking on the personality of one faction vs. another. Wasn't the original purpose of \"Divergent\", to show there were others that didn't fit into the \"cookie cutter mold\" of a particular faction, and that they were more or so \"free thinking?\" \"Insurgent\" ended on the note that there would be an impending revolution to the current faction system, and I was looking forward to seeing what Tris's part in this would be.\"Allegiant\" focused more on the scientific experiments being performed outside the city. The story was badly put together and at times felt rushed, as if the author couldn't wait to finish and just be done with the series. The people in the city were merely \"puppets\" whose strings were being pulled by those at the bureau. At times, I compared this book to the movie \"The Truman Show.\"I didn't feel the relationship between Tobias and Tris really grew, or even got the chance. I was so tired of reading about Purity Wars, GD's & GP's, Serums, conspiracies, etc.. I was terribly disappointed how Ms. Roth chose around the 90% mark of the book to kill off a major character. I felt like she killed this character for shock reason only, as there was no purpose to the death. The ending was bad, and really gave no closure. I felt empty.I don't have a problem with killing off characters or even major characters for that fact, but her method was pointless. Also, I disliked how the twisted characters of this book all of a sudden just gave up, and were like \"okay we'll do it your way, you win.\" WEAK!Were these really the same characters from the previous books?? After reading this I do not want to see the movie, knowing how it all turns out, which is EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.Ms. Roth was extremely lazy, unorganized, and lacked in giving this story a feeling of depth or character and closure.", "reviewerName": "A M Olson \"A Olson\"", "summary": "Disappointing End to a Promising Trilogy", "helpful": [10, 13], "overall": 1.0, "unixReviewTime": 1382572800, "reviewerID": "AZ7D5HYHRRN6"}

{"reviewTime": "03 21, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I loved the first two books in this series. They were tight, gripping and engrossing. Regrettably, Allegiant is better left on the shelf. My advice is to read the first two, and then decide for yourself what happens after that. I can almost guarantee you'll be more satisfied with your version than with Allegiant's. So many readers have wished they had done that, including me! Below I give the reasons why, as vaguely as possible to try to avoid spoilers.The book is not as well-written as the first two. It is much slower since most of the book is just informational or relational conversations, and the characterizations are sloppy. There is too much overt moralizing (though some of the points made are great). There are many things alluded to in all three books which are never capitalized or expanded on, which could have been utilized to tell a better story, but instead the main plot line is a rehash of Insurgent. And some devices were distracting... whenever I saw the initials \"GP\" and \"GD\" I had to think about what they stood for, and I often had to go back and check whether it was Tris or Tobias narrating each chapter. It was a much less gripping read. Worse than all of that, though, is that it is rife with plot holes and character inconsistencies. And worst of all is the ending.There are so many plot holes in the book, both in the science and in the characters, that they bleed together and it's basically just one giant hole. I saw some of these holes while reading it, and others presented themselves afterward. (I bet that among all the reviews on the site all the plot holes have been covered... wonder if someone's made a list?)The first and most glaring plot hole to me, which shows up near the beginning of the book, is this one: No scientist would ever do something (or be allowed to do something, under a normally functioning government) to a large group of people without first extensively testing it. Legitimate scientists under legitimate governments (both of which were apparently the case) ALWAYS do this. Always. And this completely unrealistic action is supposedly the premise of the ENTIRE SERIES. This should have clued me in to what I was in for in the rest of the book.The second glaring one was the reasoning behind the factions. Based on the stated goals of creating the faction systems, \"faction before blood\" and encouraging people's natural tendencies were the absolutely worst things they could have done, and the exact opposite of what was needed to attain their goals.Another head-scratcher is that all of it takes place in a bubble which does not extend past the Chicago area. There are involved parties elsewhere, but they very oddly do not respond to anything that happens in the book, when by all accounts they should. And the condition of the world outside the U.S. is never described at all. Peter studies a map of the world, but nothing is ever said about what goes on in it, or the possibility of leaving the dystopia they've been in for hundreds of years because of things that occurred ONLY in the U.S. Even though transportation (and a map) is available to just go somewhere else and get help and a better life!As for character holes... where to begin? There were so many characters that I couldn't remember who they all were. Tris and Tobias are almost the opposite of who they were in the other two books. Tobias is dense, annoying and wimpy, and Tris is arrogant and actually becomes a complete hypocrite. The plan she quickly concocts to fix a bad situation is awful, comprised of a suicide mission by someone other than herself (for once) as well as harming a group of innocent people \"for the greater good,\" a concept which was criticized throughout the series, including by Tris herself in Allegiant! Everyone immediately goes along with this as the only available option, though I thought of about 5 other viable and morally sound plans in about 5 minutes--and they had 2 days.As for the ending... the positive reviews of this book tend to express the depth of feeling the ending gave them, its power and its poignancy, and defended it on those grounds. I felt those same emotions and the same power and poignancy immediately after finishing the book. So I could have completely agreed with those reviewers about that and left it there... except for the fact that that particular ending only occurred because of the above-mentioned plot and character holes (which is, besides the ending itself, the main criticism given by the negative reviewers). Everything that happens in the end is based on those holes, and is extremely contrived. So after I stopped being caught up in the emotion, my brain kicked in and didn't let me stay accepting of the way it ended. And as a bit more time passed, I found myself thinking of several other reasons to dislike the conclusion, regardless of its potential power, poignancy, etc etc. I realized that the things that moved me could still have been present with a different ending... and in fact with a better story overall. The ending was completely avoidable, contradictory and over the top, and weakened the story. It's apparently something the author wanted to do all along, so she basically molded the story to achieve a certain ending, and the molding was not well done or believable.So I have to conclude, like so many other reviewers, that the author (who didn't have a reason for Chicago being the way it was when she wrote Divergent) got to a point where she was so successful, and so pressured for the finale, that she got arrogant and careless and was allowed to get away with it and publish a sub-par book. It's really too bad. I will try to put Allegiant out of my head as much as possible, and imagine what else might have happened after the end of Insurgent. And I will hope that there is a really good writer out there who will write a fan fiction alternative to Allegiant!P.S. I saw the Divergent movie tonight. Some reviewers had said that this book would ruin the movie and the series for them. I found that was not the case. The movie was wonderful and I'm so glad I watched it; it took away some of the bad taste I'd had from this book. I wonder how the filmmakers will handle all the problems with Allegiant!

But what really frustrated me with the novel was the fact that it does not fit with the other two. The first and second parts are fantastic and are hard to put down! Allegiant, however, lacks the magic for a couple of reasons.First, there are two different point of views. Usually when an author does this, it allows the reader even greater insight to BOTH characters, but in this case, it only was used in order to continue the book when one of them dies. It does get confusing as to who is talking in each chapter and the characters do not grow. We learn little about each that we didn't know before.Secondly, the plot was slow. They immediately enter the potential plot in the beginning (no spoilers, I promise), but then that's it. Nothing truly happens that is significant. Life goes on, and it feels like \"blah, blah, blah\". Everything that happens is not significant. In addition, I feel like the character's reactions are not that realistic. If I was in their position and found out what they did, I'd be freaking out. They just are like, \"oh, ok.\" Who does that? You would never expect that from these characters, especially after the events of the first two.Finally, the end. This is the reason most people are mad. I've read a bunch of novels with a similar ending, and I don't really have a problem with it. People should react the way they are, because, if they don't, then the character didn't make an impact. I just wish it wasn't so anticlimactic and predictable. You know it's coming.I gave it 3 stars because I feel like there is potential, and I do recommend reading it just because you have to know what happens. But, I just can't give it more- there are too many issues. Sorry, Roth.

{"reviewTime": "11 19, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "WARNING-----&#62;SPOILERS AHEAD!**************NOTE: Before I get into anything in regards to this book I am stating right now and as clear as day that there will be spoilers in this review. If I could get around it I would but it is basically impossible based on this being a last book in a series and what actually went down in the book. If you do not want to be spoiled I suggest that you stop reading right now, pick up the book, and then come back and see what I have to say.First things first, Allegiant was by far the best series ending I have ever read. Now with saying this I have to tell you my sentiment is in the minority. People are furious with how this book ended. They feel cheated and they feel used and there is a huge controversy brewing over this. But for me Allegiant was the perfect ending for a series about choices and it really couldn't have gone any better. It broke my heart, gave me such book anxiety that I was dreaming about the characters(a good Theo James dream never hurt anyone!) and affected me in a way a series never has before. Veronica Roth made a gutsy choice much like the choices in the series and I applaud her for that decision.Allegiant is the final chapter in the story of Tris, Four and company and dystopian Chicago. After the cliffhanger ending that was Insurgent and the death and carnage that was Divergent Allegiant is the story of what is outside the city walls. About what is true and what has been falsified. About how the city came to be what it is today. About the choices we all make. About life and death. Armed with the knowledge that there is life outside the city walls Tris and Four and a few other familiar faces journey away from the tumultuous world where Evelyn(Four's mother) is a tyrannical leader to an unknown place that is as strange as it is familiar. Integrating themselves into this new society which has no factions but a Bureau and a clear division between what is known as GPs(genetically pure) and GDs(genetically damaged). As lies begin to be uncovered and sides are drawn Tris and Four have to make some hard choices that could affect themselves, their loved ones and their relationship forever.Okay so I'm the first to admit that Allegiant is very heavy with the world building which is completely understandable in this case. Us, as readers, needed a clear picture of just exactly was taking place outside the fence. And even though it is heavy with world building I think Roth did it pretty flawlessly by never using 50 words when 10 could suffice(a pet peeve of mine) and making sure we felt like part of the world, could see all sides of the argument, had a choice on what to believe ourselves. And although it was a lot of information I think it aided in the story as we got to see just what this characters were up against. Simply put, discrimination was happening between the GPs and the GDs and Roth made sure the readers saw that so we understood the choices that Tris and Four had whether we agreed with them or not.Another part of Allegiant that was different but worked was the use of dual points of views. From the first two books we only got to see Tris perspective, her thoughts on things, her reasoning behind why she was behaving the way she was. Making another tough decision Roth decided to tell Allegiant using Four's voice as well and I have to say I was a little worried about this when I heard the announcement that this would be the set up for Allegiant. But in true Roth fashion she made a believer out of me. From the first time a chapter was from Four's POV I knew exactly why she had decided to go that route and I embraced it. I was no longer left to wonder what was going on in the sexy, former Dauntless instructors head. I no longer had to wonder if he really had any flaws or doubts or self-esteem issues. It was nice to finally see Four as a broken boy that felt uncertain of his past and of his future and of himself. Up until this point it was hinted at that he didn't want to be like his father and that was a fear of his, but Allegiant brought it to the surface and showed just how much damage was done emotionally to him by both of his parents.Allegiant also showed the growth of Tris. In Divergent she was a naive girl just trying to fit in and do what she thought was right. In Insurgent she was a girl that had demons she couldn't escape and in trying to do so became self-destructive and had no thoughts for the others that loved her. But in Allegiant Tris was his powerhouse girl that made tough calls and no longer was a adrenaline junkie. She grew up and was ready to do what was right and to make the choices she had to. Was this damning to her relationship to Four at times, it was, but I also understood where it was coming from. The ups and downs in their relationship, although uncomfortable for me to read, were natural as they made choices the other didn't agree with, but I never once didn't feel the love or the connection or their emotional bond. Someone in the book said it best, they were really good for each other.&#60;MAJOR SPOILER ALERT&#62;But really, all of my thoughts on the above is nothing compared to what happened in the final 10% of the book that rocked a fan base across the world. A decision that was so gutsy that it left infuriated people in its wake. Roth did the one thing that very few authors are will to do. She killed off one of her main characters...she killed off Tris. And you know what, she made the right decision. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I cried, straight up ugly cry, sobbing for the last 30 minutes of reading this book. My heart was 100% shattered and it ached when I was finished. But I still think one of the most gusty calls was the right call because everything aside it fit right in with everything that we knew about Tris and the Divergent series from the beginning. This series from the get go was about choices. The Choosing Ceremony, picking faction over blood, choosing sides, choosing violence over piece, choosing the city over life outside the fence, choosing to live or die, choosing to leave. Everything was about choices and when it came down to it the biggest choice had to be made by Tris and she did it in a way she never thought fit her. She did it after being told time and time again that she would never have this characteristic. She did it out of pure selflessness and that is why Roth made the right call. Tris was one of the most selfless people in the book and by giving her life, her safety up to save the lives of all of the people that had helped her and touched her and loved her, she did the most selfless thing a person could do. She choose them.So yes, I know that my opinion is on an island of its own. I know that Allegiant is unfairly being racked through the coals and I also know that if people took a minute to think about it and to think of all the pieces that feel into place through the series and the guts it took for Roth to do this to one of her babies, I think you will start to see the magic that is Allegiant. I think you will start to see why this book is my pick for best series ender. You'll see why I wasn't disappointed even though it devastated me.  Veronica Roth did something amazing with Allegiant and I will forever be grateful to her for bringing this story and these people into my life. And for having the guts to do it the way she did.

These arguments are continued in Insurgent where we discover this dystopian society is nothing but an artifice.In the finale of a Dystopian trilogy, my major expectation is that where a big Sociological question is asked, an answer will be given and supported by arguments presented through the storyline.  MOCKINGJAY's big failure was not even bothering to answer the question.  Allegiant gave an answer, but only TOLD the argument, all attempts to SHOW us the answer were muted and overshadowed by the use of one of the poorest plot devices ever invented - the memory serum. Instead of a valiant fight against their treatment, their NURTURE, the \"heroes\" ended up just showing their NATURE by using their resistance to serums to use the memory serum to cheat the system.  It was so full of mixed messages that it imploded on itself.Divergent also included a strong vein of YA Romance, with a hero and heroine that drove the story and whom we all loved.  I won't go as far as to say you should NEVER kill the heroine in a YA Romance, but if you do, it needs to be a transcendent moment, a supreme sacrifice, the emotional crucible of the entire story.  The readers need to feel both saddened and fulfilled by the loss.  Tris's death was none of these things.  Getting shot while using the aforementioned poor plot device (memory serum) was not an emotional moment, unless getting pissed at the author counts (which it doesn't).Like HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT showed so much promise.

{"reviewTime": "11 10, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I had seen some reviews prior to reading the book but avoided spoilers.  I expected that the fanatics were very angry because they didn't like the ending, and I admit my own prejudices regarding the &#8220;novella&#8221; releases feeling that the author had sort of lost her way when the movie deal happened.  So the beginning of the book was a struggle because I was looking for the issues and decline.First, there is no quick recap of where we were in the story.  I&#8217;m sorry, it had been 4 months since I read book 2 (the novellas don&#8217;t count because they were not related to the plot at the end of book 2).  I've read many books between and since I&#8217;m not a Divergent fanatic, I would have appreciated a short refresher.  Next biggest issue was the changing point of view between Tris and Tobias.  The chapter&#8217;s listed whose point of view we were reading but isn't that an indication of the problem with this format?  Even with this notation, I&#8217;d sometimes page back to check because it was hard to know whose voice I was reading.Spoiler alert starts here&#8230;I assume that the author used the changing point of views because of the ending but maybe writing in the third person would have been a better solution.  The first two books were written from Tris&#8217; point of view and some novellas were from Tobias&#8217; point of view, but the combination was confusing in the third book.  I didn't like that Tobias was weak throughout this book.  He wasn't the reluctant leader we were used to, but more a lost soul.  I don&#8217;t know if it was a device because he was out of his element and environment or not.  I didn't like that his mother became a crying brooding mess when she had been so brutally strong, and that she gave in without a blink of an eye.  And like other reviewers, it would have been nice to better understand exactly why Tris was immune to all the serums and more about her being gene purified.The short chapters made the pace of the book move along quickly for me.  And I suddenly realized that I was getting into the story for the first time in all the books and didn't want to put the book down.  I had forgotten about the bad reviews and my opinion of the novellas.  The very very very short chapters for Tobias at the end helped express his emotional crisis poignantly.  The fanatics may not have liked it but I thought Tobias&#8217; reactions were very emotional and the final zip line trip well written.  There was some preachiness at the end that I could have done without but it wasn't over the top.If you&#8217;re a fanatic, you won&#8217;t be happy to lose a loved character and feel that there was no retribution.  I debated between 3 and 4 stars and decided to go with 4 because I liked this book better than the first two.  I like happy endings in fiction, but I know they can&#8217;t always turn out that way.

I understand that this is fiction, but it is hard to follow all the characters and locations in this story.A lot of people don't care for the ending of Allegiant.

That is why it was so disappointing for me to only award three out of five stars. Of course, if a reader has enjoyed the first two, they should certainly read the final installment, but be warned for the same disappointment I felt.This does not mean I did not enjoy the book at all. I found the tender moments between Tris and Four addictive and I was happy with Tris' ever-growing strength as a leader and warrior, HOWEVER, I found myself bored by the lack of action and some of the supporting characters. It almost felt like even more description could have been included to develop the characters and plot more (but that would probably elicit complaints about length or need for another book).I was also frustrated with Four through a majority of the novel. I know he was going through an identity crisis, but he seemed to lose the strength and resolve that made him so damn sexy in the first two.SPOILER ALERT: I was also very upset with the ending. Now, this may be biased because I want the couples of my favorite fictions to end up happily ever after (I know that is not how the real world works), and that was not the case. I get the theme that Roth was aiming for, about war never being kind and sacrifices and all that depressing realistic nonsense, but COME ON! I couldn't believe it was happening when I read it. I live in the real world, I get enough depressing realistic nonsense that I want to escape from when reading my favorite novels. But, that's just me. I really did enjoy the epilogue and how Four's character grew and learned from the experience, but still...now if there was a spin-off where a spunky blonde teacher (aka me) hooks up with Four, then I might be satisfied.Okay, tirade over. I love Roth's writing and I commend her on staying true to her intentions and doling out the tough love to her readers, but I will probably prefer to think of Insurgent as the ending to this trilogy (and pray that they change the Allegiant movie, or I am going to be a sobbing mess!)Angela Youngers, author and book loverPainting Wallsconnect with Angela on Twitter: @AngelaYoungers", "reviewerName": "Angie Youngers \"Angela Youngers, author and b...", "summary": "A must-read to finish the series, but a bit disappointing", "helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1388188800, "reviewerID": "A3J137EWRE529F"}

Unlike the first two books, which I read in a day or two because I couldn't put them down, it took me weeks to get through this book, because it was BORING.  Absolutely nothing happens for chapters and chapters; the characters just wander around learning the back story.As for the back story, it makes absolutely no sense.  The plot is nonsensical and everyone acts completely out of character.  I won't say more about the actual plot to avoid posting spoilers, but many reviewers have already written very thoughtful criticisms of the specific plot points, which I completely agree with.The writing is also sub-par.  The use of dual voices is a tricky thing to do well, and this book fails.  Both voices sound the same.  Just like all the other reviewers, I had to page back to the heading of each chapter to remind myself whose viewpoint I was reading.  If you are interested in a dystopian book that does dual viewpoints well, check out Legend by Marie Lu.As for the &#34;experiments&#34; premise of the book, if you are interested in that kind of story, check out the Maze Runner series by James Dashner.  The reason that series succeeds while this one fails, is that Dashner is comfortable leaving many details unexplained.  This book tries to explain every last question, down to the very genetics, and the explanations make no sense.Finally, obviously one can't write a review of this book without addressing the ending.  I was very disappointed in the ending -- not because of what happened, but because just like the rest of the plot, it made no sense, and therefore lacked any emotional impact whatsoever.  The only emotion I felt was annoyance that the author was so clearly trying to manipulate me.Really not sure what happened with this book; perhaps it was rushed to press to finish the series before the movies come out.  As for the movies, I will not be going to see them.  If you're already invested in this series, having read the first two books, then I guess you have to slog through this one to get closure.

However, first of all, let me get my one complaint out of the way.  I hate the shifting viewpoints in this book.  The book shifts from chapter to chapter from Tobias to Tris.  Normally, I have NO PROBLEM with shifting viewpoints whatsoever, however, in this particular series, the first two books were told COMPLETELY from Tris' point of view.  Changing that around in the third and final book was very irritating because I wasn't used to it.  I'd start reading a chapter and get three or four pages into the chapter and then there would be a line similar to this:  &#34;I can't believe I'm looking at the man who tried to kill my girlfriend.&#34;And I would be completely turned around.  I'd think, &#34;Wait... Someone tried to kill Tris' &lt;I>girl&lt;/I>friend?  Tris &lt;I>had&lt;/I> a girlfriend?  That makes no sense.&#34;  And then, of course, I'd realize, &#34;Oh yes.  This is another Tobias chapter.&#34;  I feel like, if the author was going to be flip-flopping viewpoints, she should have found a way to do so throughout the entire series or not at all.However, despite that irritating inconvenience, I loved the book.  It wasn't a shocking revelation like I think the author was going for, but it didn't matter.  It was still wonderfully put together and is a wonderful comment on the state of governmental affairs and absolute power.Also, there are not very many books -- especially YA novels -- that have anything other than a typical, Hollywood happy-ending these days.  That is why the ending to this novel -- this series -- was so poignant and perfect.

You can (and should because it's quite beautiful) read her response here.Don't get me wrong, I cried like a baby. So much so that I had to make myself a cup of tea and watch the entirety of Dirty Dancing at 3 a.m. in order to stop feeling so upset. But I love that Tris died, and I love how it ended, so if you want to hate me for that, go for it.Here's what I liked: First off, I really liked the entire genetic experiment plot line. It was completely unexpected and I thought it was a realistic concept for what was outside the city. There was also a lot of room for all that drama to go down so that was a nice touch, and I appreciate her adding some interesting new characters to the story. I loved that Tobias forgave his mother. I never hated Evelyn, I disliked the lengths she was willing to go to to \"save\" the city, but I never hated her. She was doing what she thought was best. But I'm glad that she and Tobias were able to put it in the past and patch up their relationship, it was what Tobias needed. With his father being the awful human that he was, and Tris dying, it wouldn't have been fair to leave Tobias all on his own.What I didn't like: I love that it was in dual point of view, but I feel like there wasn't a lot of difference in tone between Tobias and Tris. Now, it wasn't horrible and I could still tell whose POV we were in, but it would have been nice to see a difference in the way they thought (though maybe that makes them even more perfect together?). That's the short list of what I didn't like, and we can now move on to my spiel on Tris's death.This is important. Rule number one. If you never take away anything from any of these posts but this, that would be okay. Never, never, never threaten an author because you didn't like the way a book ended. Threats aren't okay, guys, and from what I've heard, Veronica got a lot of them. Like I said before, she wrote what would best serve the book and she planned this from the very beginning of the series. You're all entitled to your own opinions, and emotional responses are the best, but just don't threaten writers because you didn't like their decisions. Not cool.Now here's why I think Tris's death was possibly one of the greatest things to happen in YA history, and maybe what caused this book to head to the top of my favorite series list: It was the ultimate sacrifice. Like the lovely Shailene Woodley said in an interview, Tris is constantly battling between being fearless and being selfless, being Dauntless or Abnegation. In the end, she didn't have to choose between the two, they were both a part of who she was. By sacrificing her life for her city and the people she loved, she was fearless and selfless, a true member of both factions. Tris gives a beautiful speech before she dies that really shows why this had to happen. On page 473, she says, \"She [her mother] taught me all about real sacrifice. That is should be done from love, not misplaced disgust for another person's genetics. That is should be done from necessity, not without exhausting all other options. That is should be done for people who need your strength because they don't have enough of their own.\" This is a completely different girl from the start of the series, this is a woman who has been through hell and back and has made the decision to do what's best for other people. And she's not terrified, she accepts it. Hello, character development. Also as a side note, Tobias's reaction is heartbreaking and very real. He's angry and he's numb and he carries it with him forever. That part was, to me, harder to read than the actual death scene itself. Four for you Veronica Roth, you go Veronica Roth. (Other side note, if you really want to have a good cry, read the death scene and listen to \"Oblivion\" by Bastille... and then prepare for the waterworks)Those are my thoughts, and you can agree or disagree as much as you want. I just think it was a poetic ending and I wouldn't want to change a thing. I could talk about this book for days, and I would like to apologize to the people who are still having to listen to me talk about it. So, thank you, Veronica. Thank you for taking the risk and having the guts to write your story the way it wanted to be written. Thank you for letting us all be a part of Tris's life and adventures, the good and the bad.

{"reviewTime": "05 8, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "You know those reviews that say &#34;If I could give it zero stars I would&#34;? Yeah, this is gonna be one of them.So, we finally get all the answers we wanted - and nothing else. For me, a good story should leave the read with questions. Not about the plot or the characters, but about the overall meaning and theme. For example, JK Rowling never does answer if Snape is a good person. She tells us he's a brave person, which yes he is, but not if he's morally correct or not. That's left up to the readers, and we've continued to discuss (read: argue endlessly) that topic.This book doesn't do that. Tris and Tobias were so preachy I wanted to throw this book across the room. Every chapter is filled with some sort of &#34;wisdom&#34; about the humanity. The thing is, all the preachy quips are obviously just the author's own opinions about the world. None of it fits the characters and it really pulled me out of the story.For example:&#34;And now that you're out? How does the world seem to you?&#34;&#34;Mostly the same, people are just divided by different things, fighting different wars.&#34;This would have been wise, if the author had bothered for it to be in character, for it to fit the present situation, and if it was brought up later for the sake of something like consistency.But we didn't just get answers about 'what it means to be human' oh no we also got answers about 'what it means to be divergent'. Let me tell you something, if it was possible to murder books, I would have murdered this one on the basis of poor research and world building alone.This paragraph is where things get a little spoilery, not by much, just a little warning. At one point we're told about &#34;murder genes&#34; and how they're the cause for human aggression. Not long after that we're told that if you take away someone's low intelligience you take away their compassion as well. Yes, you read that right, apparently in order for someone to be nice they have to be dumb as well. And this is the part that made me have to turn off my kindle and just pace for about half an hour, whispering things under my breath that if my mother had heard me she would have sent me to a psychiatrist. Because this is such crap. Compassion, or treating people with understanding and kindness, comes from empathy. Empathy comes from you being able to relate to someone, to see things from their point of view. Do you think that if someone wasn't smart they would be able to do that?When the research is actually truthful, it's highschool-level. At some point we learn about the difference between memories of personal experience and memories of how to do things. The difference between remembering what the weather was like when we learned to ride a bike and how to ride a book. We learn that those two types of memories are stored in difference types of the brain. This is passed as very science-y and advanced and all I could think about was &#34;I literally learned this in highschool psychology class&#34;I'm getting worked up again, so we're just going to move onto the characters, or lack thereof. When I read Divergent, I saw that the characters could use more dimensionality, but there were two more books so I figured that they would develop into more complex people later on. Not at all.As you probably know by now, this book is in both Tris and Tobias point of view. Every time the POV switched to Tobias I had a hard time remembering he wasn't Tris. The author obviously didn't know how to write this character beyond &#34;badass boyfriend&#34;. For most of the book all we get out of Tobias is that he pities himself because of something revealed about his genetics. There is a giant ton of fake man-pain going on in this book. I was rolling my eyes so much I thought they were going to fall out. When he finally gets a grip on himself, he becomes so bland I almost wanted to the brooding man-child back. Almost.Then we have Tris who has somehow changed into a full on not-gonna-take-any-shit-from-nobody-cause-i'm-tough badass woman. I didn't believe any of it for a second. The author's idea of what makes a 'strong' character seems more to be of what makes a 'cool' character. Tris is trying too hard to prove to the reader that she's strong and I got sick of it real fast. And there's really nothing to her beyond that. She's strong. That's it. Apparently she's smart too, but none of the scenes where she's supposed to be showing off her 'intelligence' convinced me because all of it was freaking obvious.Then we have the side characters. They all had exactly one personality trait and that was it, just like the first book. Nothing about them has changed. Characters like Cara, Christina and Uriah are just the smart one, the best friend, and the funny one. Characters like Peter and Evelyn make character changes that are so forced and fast I had whiplash. One paragraph they&#8217;re one thing, and then the next they&#8217;re another.Remember how at the first book the conflict was about the factions all against each other? And then at the second book it was the factionless against the factions? We sort of get an answer to that conflict, but it happens off screen. Yes, that's right, what this entire trilogy has been building up to be was quickly tied up in a bow when we weren't looking.We find out more about Tris' mom, and once again I didn't care. We find more about the world outside the city, and I don't care. Tris at point thinks her parents would be ashamed of her, and I don't care. Quite a few people die, and I don't care. What I'm trying to say here is that character complexity and development needs to be the most important thing for a writer. If you don't give me a reason to like these characters beyond &#34;This one is cool, this one has a tortured past, this one is sassy, this one is funny&#34; I'm not going to like them. And I'm definitely not going to care about what or who they do.TLDR: This book is full of the author's preachy opinions forced on us as 'wisdom', absolutely no character development, some of the worst worldbuilding I've ever seen, research that was done so poorly I had to stop reading to calm myself done, and an ending that is forced and overly-melodramatic.

The whole introduction of a new world and new plot lines was too much for one book. If she wanted to go with the story she did, I think it would have been better with more books. It was too rushed and difficult to understand. And I was really annoyed by the Tris and Tobias dynamic. They spent pretty much the entire book fighting. Neither of them acted the same way they did in Divergent. Yes I know characters evolve, but it took away what made them special! Tris is supposed to be strong but caring and selfless. In this book she was hardheaded, temperamental and not at all like Tris from the pat books. Tobias was whiny and stupid, which made me mad because in earlier books he was strong, independent, and he could think for himself and come up with a good decision on his own. As other reviewers have noted, Tris and Tobias often sounded as if they were the same person. I would have to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose POV I was in.

I loved the first two books... truly I could not put them down.  I fell in love with the characters, the plot, the conflict, the world and definitely the love story between Tris and Tobias.The third book had a LOT of high expectations riding on it... there was a lot of stuff that needed to be resolved and while I admit a lot of it was resolved, the way in which said resolution was delivered was one of the most disappointing, depressing and tragic endings I have ever had the misfortune of reading.  I stay awake at night thinking about this when I should be sleeping, and so I write this review in hopes that getting this down in writing will give me enough peace of mind that I can move on from this travesty of a series and never have to look back.  It is nearly impossible to write this review without giving direct spoilers, but I will try my best.First of all, the BIG REVEAL that they are hinting at and leading up to with what is beyond the walls of their little world was very underwhelming and in my opinion, pretty unoriginal.  Sadly, the idea that this book might be some dystopian version of M. Night Shaymalan's &#34;The Village&#34; did cross my mind as I was part way through book 2 when then started hinting and something beyond the walls... but I thought to myself &#34;no way would she write something that lame&#34;  well yes... she did... epic. fail.Secondly, there are a LOT of holes in the story, incredibly huge gaping ones that make no sense what so ever.  The justifications for everything that has been done to these people, from day one make no sense.  If they wanted to keep everyone under control and in the town, why would they ever choose to arm the governing faction with information that would cause people to want to leave?  Why would that message even be delivered in such as a way as to encourage such a thing?  It made no sense.  It feels like the author wrote the books without having any idea of how she was going to resolve the giant mess of conflict that she created.Thirdly, the ending... I am at a complete and total loss of words for that.  The first two issues I could certainly have forgiven or overlooked, but I cannot in my mind find any reason why the author would choose to do what she did IN A YA NOVEL.  If there was some reason behind it, some kind of important lesson to be learned or some benefit, even some insurmountable obstacle to be overcome... but there was not.  I could not think of a single reason why the author had to end it the way she did, on such a depressing note after you spend SO MUCH effort to build up such a strong relationship with a character you grow to love and has grown so much in the course of your adventure with these books.  I feel cheated, disappointed and depressed.If I had to go back and say whether or not I feel like the time I've spent over the last three days was worth this kind of disappointment I felt at the conclusion of this seires?

I have to look to the Harry Potter series for a comparison. What Rowling did so brilliantly is to gradually expand the size of the characters' world and the weight of their problems, which mirrors the typical process of children becoming young adults. Allegiant takes a very big and sudden plot twist- that the inhabitants of the city were actually placed there by an outside party for unknown reasons- and attempts to resolve the characters' reaction to that knowledge and how it effects their relationships in a VERY short amount of time. I felt like Roth presented a complex and intriguing issue and then just hurried through the end of the story without adequately exploring it. This series could EASILY have had a fourth book and probably would have benefited from it. It felt very much as though Roth was worried that her readers would lose patience with her if she slowed her pace at all, even if it meant a better story. I say you're not doing your readers any service to assume they can't handle a thoroughly told story.

{"reviewTime": "04 12, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "**This review contains spoilers**I was very nervous when picking up Veronica Roth's final installment of the Divergent series because I had heard rumors that the series ending was horrible. This worried me because I found Roth's voice and her unique style to be refreshing in the first two installments and would have hated to see it ruined by a bad ending choice.While I understand while some readers were disappointed with the way the series ended, I have to say I was not one of them. I have always been under the belief that Tris' character's only purpose was to highlight who I believed to be the best written character in the book (aka Tobias). I have always felt that Tris as a character lacked the well-roundedness of Tobias's character. While usually I would cite this as a criticism of the author, in this case it worked. It worked because the character of Tris did exactly what it was supposed to do, highlight Tobias and bring out the multi-dimensional traits of his character.I too loved the romance between Tris and Tobias. I loved it's innocence and I loved its simplicity. However what made their romance so great was not the actual romance as much as the context for which it began and grew. Roth did not write an exceptional love story, she wrote a basic love story and she placed it in the middle of a dystopian world in which it flourished and proved wrong all of the other contextual occurings that were happening simultaneously.Tris' death should not be looked at as a bad ending to the story. While I was in fact saddened by her death I was more sad for Tobias' reaction to it then the fact that she would cease to fill the pages of the book anymore. In many ways I found her death to be her defining moment where she stepped out and became a real character for the first time. I personally loved Roth's ending. I felt like Tobias' story was always the actual story and watching him survive until the last page and learn and grow and mourn was beautiful. It was like Roth never gave up on Tobias, she refused to erase his memory and she refused to let him cease being the person that Tris' character highlighted so well.

I LOVED Divergent so much. It pulled me out of a massive reading rut and made me fall in love with YA again. Then I read Insurgent and was not wowed. Honestly, I think I should have given the book more like 2.5 or 3 stars (I gave it 4.. no idea why, especially after re-reading my review).I was excited about Allegiant because of the big bang ending that was in Insurgent, but honestly my hopes weren't that high. I wasn't convinced that Allegiant was going to wow me, and I was right.***I don't like how Tris and Tobias pushed aside their problems by making outTris and Tobias's relationship still isn't perfect in Allegiant. They have things they need to talk about and discuss. But ANY time this situation comes up, they bury it by making out. It's literally like:\"We need to ta--\"Suddenly I felt his mouth on mine. [Cue make out scene.]Paraphrasing, but that's the gist of it. SO.MANY.TIMES. It's almost like they thought they had to make up for their fighting/distance in Insurgent, but this was not the right way to do it! You can't just hope your problems will go away by cutting them off with a kiss. It doesn't work like that.***I kind of wish Tris and Tobias just didn't have a relationship at allI grew to hate Tris and Tobias's relationship. Adding onto the previous point, I just felt like their relationship was so half ass. Except when they were making out, they didn't act like a couple. They didn't treat each other like equals. There were still plenty of times when they didn't clue each other in on their thoughts/plans. They just didn't feel TOGETHER.Maybe this is extremely stereotypical of me, but there were so many moments when I felt that Tris and Tobias should have reacted in a certain way as a couple (like comforted the other person, or sought comfort from them), but they reacted so indifferently instead.\"I could stay and try to comfort him, but I need answers about my mother, and I'm not going to wait any longer.\"Except when their lips were glued together, I just didn't look at them and think, \"You guys are dating. You love each other.\" Instead I saw.. colleagues? Maybe friends?I felt like labeling what they had as a relationship just brought the story down. I honestly would have preferred if their relationship was just cut from the book because it kept disappointing me.\"But no more lies. Not ever\"\"Okay.\"I feel stiff and squeezed, like my body was just forced into something too small for it.Because being completely open and honest with Tobias makes her feel restricted and contained? *eye roll****Tobias and Tris had the same voice.In Allegiant, the chapters switch between Tris and Tobias's points of view, but I couldn't tell them apart. I often had to double check the chapter heading because I couldn't tell whose point of view I was reading from.I think if you're going to have alternating points of view, you have to have two very distinct voices. Tris and Tobias didn't sound or feel particularly different.***I didn't love any of the characters.Overall, the character development and relationships were poor. I already talked about Tris and Tobias, but I couldn't connect to ANY of the characters really. I just felt so little for them.Tobias on his own was weak. I remember loving him in Divergent because he was such a hardened badass. In Allegiant he's constantly doubting himself, wallowing in grief, blaming himself for everything... it got to be a bit pathetic and I just wanted to yell at him and tell him to quit with the self pity.I loved Christina in Divergent, but I was indifferent towards her in Allegiant.There were a bunch of other characters but they all felt so fleeting. They dodged in and out of the book and I never got a sense of who they were and never formed any attachments to them.***I hated how we were given two separate societies and two separate rebellions.It made it hard for me to figure out where I should concentrate. On the one hand we had the rebellion within the Chicago city. The factionless rebelled and are trying to take over and convert the whole city into a factionless society.Then on the other hand, we have the whole of the United States. With this society we have a whole other rebellion. Once this one started up, I felt like I was being pulled in two different directions. I didn't know if the rebellion in Chicago was still important, and I didn't know what to even focus on! I hated how we were introduced into one conflict, and then suddenly jerked into a different one.***The time period was weird.In Allegiant we get the sense that the story takes place at least hundreds of years in the future. We know that the experiments have been running for at least ~7 generations (about 210 years). But I don't think that when they started was 2013 either. It was probably at least 2050 when they started (if not later), then that means Allegiant takes place around 2260.The exact timing isn't important, but what is important is that the Divergent series takes place hundreds of years in the future. And yet... I thought there was so little advancement. All the tech seemed like 2013 tech. It's like advancement was stunted, but the years kept rolling by. They still use guns, normal trucks, airplane travel seems the same, etc. With all the wars and uprisings, I would have expected really advanced weaponry.Sure they had the serums and the fear landscapes, but that's about it...***I didn't like how the serums felt more like magic than science.In particular, I'm talking about the death serum. Surely this serum is like a chemical weapon, right? Like I imagine it being comparable to nerve gas. Everyone who comes into contact with it dies. And yet... Tris can magically survive it through mind power It's literally like she just willed herself not to die. I can understand overcoming fears and simulations, kind of like lucid dreaming. But I can't imagine the death serum being anything but a biological killer.. like nerve gas. And yet Tris can overcome it with just the power of her mind? O_O This makes zero sense to me.***I did not like the ending.Maybe some people will like it for being `powerful' or `gutsy' or `emotional'. I just didn't like it.[I'll be honest, I tend to hate any ending where the main character dies. It's just not how I like to read stories. And in Allegiant, Tris dies. Whenever this happens in books, I get left with a sense of \"What's the point?\" I spend three books reading from a character's point of view, watching them grow and change, connecting with them (hopefully), just to have them offed. Even if the conflict was resolved (in this case it was), I can't help but feeling like it was pointless or wasted time.But although I didn't like the ending, it wasn't because I loved Tris and couldn't bear to see her die. Emotionally, I didn't actually feel anything when she died. I wasn't upset or teary. I was only angry because of that whole `pointless' feeling. I think that just goes to show how detached I've become since Divergent.Additionally, I thought the ending with Tobias and his mother was so... lame... and easy. Tobias gave his mother an ultimatum. He said: stop trying to rule the city and form a treaty with the Allegiant, or lose me as your son. And she just pulled him into her arms and tearfully said, \"I choose you!\" Why couldn't he have said that to her an entire book ago?Also I felt nothing when Uriah died. Honestly I kind of forgot who he was going into Allegiant and he was so absent through the entire story that I just didn't care at all when he went into a coma, and I again didn't care at all when they pulled the plug on him.***Allegiant was about what I expected.After Insurgent, I think Allegiant was exactly what I expected it to be. I don't feel like Tris and Tobias's relationship ever \"healed\", and for the rest I was just mildly indifferent. Throw in a few other problems, and it's about what I expected it to be.I still look back on Divergent fondly, but I think overall I just don't like where the series went.

I'd read mixed reviews before going into Allegiant (although I somehow managed to avoid spoilers even though I was still active on websites where this book was discussed... thanks for being awesome, internet people!), so I was a little afraid this book might let me down. But it didn't. It definitely didn't.The beginning was a little slow for me, and other parts seemed really rushed, but I think part of that was from having to create an entirely new part of this world. Everything Tris and Tobias know is questioned, and everything has to be rebuilt from the ground up. I think there was a lot more telling in this book instead of things being inferred, but I'm not really sure how else it would have been done all in one book. The world-building was a little lacking in this book compared to the other ones, but it didn't bother me as much as it typically would.I did really enjoy that this story was told from two perspectives though. It was a little jarring at first - since the first two are solely from Tris' perspective, Tobias took a little bit to get used to. But then, I don't think this story would have worked any other way. Divergent and Insurgent were definitely Tris' story to tell, but this one belongs to both of them in so many ways. Tobias has issues that he has to deal with, and Tris has her own problems, and it wouldn't have made any sense for Tris to really be able to explain Tobias' problems and thoughts and actions. It was a risky choice, but I think it's one that definitely enhanced this last book.As I was reading this book, I felt like it had a Maze Runner feel to it. I don't want to spoil anything for either series, but I think people who have read The Maze Runner will understand. One of those &#34;society isn't always what you think it is, we're doing this for your own good&#34; kind of things.The pacing in this book was definitely very fast-paced, but I think the rest of the series is too so it wasn't off-putting. The whole series is a gigantic roller coaster ride, and this book was true to that. Especially with all of the feels. Oh, the feels. So many emotions on opposite ends of the spectrum that I should have been prepared for but wasn't really. So thanks for that, Veronica. You win.I don't want to say too much about the ending, because it's one I think everyone should experience on their own (if you haven't had it spoiled yet, keep avoiding those spoilers!), but I will say that I thought it was excellently done. It was risky, and I know quite a few people were outraged by it and hated the book because of it. I, however, think it remained true to the characters. After reading it, I don't think this series could have ended any other way.If you've read Divergent and Insurgent, you will definitely want to read Allegiant! It has its flaws, but I think it wraps up the series well. I mean, even the epilogue is true to all of the characters. Usually I hate the epilogues, but I enjoyed this one.

Many people still believe  in and want the factions and create the group called the Allegiant. In the quest to discover what is outside the fence of the city, a group including Tris and Tobias (four) sneak out of the city and discover the truth. They discover that they are part of an experiment to create genetically pure people (divergent). Tris discovers that her mother was a part of the government and was placed into the experiment to work from the inside.

I am not a fan of the multi narrative in this book. The other two are from the perspective of Tris and I understand in a way why she chose to write it this way, but I did not like it. The beginning of the book was very confusing and there was a lot going on that caused me to have to re-read it. I did like the way in which Roth finally began to answer some questions and give background to how the city, experiments and world came to be. The addition of all the gene information takes the book in a very different direction and seemed very confusing and proved to be kind of boring. It took me until the last 100 pages to really get into the book. Tris and Four have changed a lot and I don't think I like who they have become. Four has become soft and so obsessed with Tris, I liked him much better as the strong dauntless that he once was. And Tris has become so self involved and cocky. This book was a let down for me.

{"reviewTime": "10 26, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Spoilers*SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*You've been warned....Meh. This book was okay. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it. It didn't really make me feel anything beyond some boredom and a little annoyance. And therein lies the problem I guess. I SHOULD have felt something after three books. Mostly I just felt like I was being whined or preached at. And my issues with it, unlike many others, do not hinge on Tris's ultimate demise.I do not recognize these characters. Tris and Tobias seem to have become entirely different people through this trilogy. I guess that could be attributed to trauma and personal growth. Okay, fine. But I don't like this Tris and Tobias. And they don't seem to have grown, if anything they regressed. First of all, I couldn't tell them apart. At all. Every time I was in a Tobais chapter I thought I was reading Tris until he referred to her or Nita or some other character that would have been Tobias-centric instead of Tris-centric. Tobias started as this strong, brave, SMART, mysterious tough guy type. I can understand revealing some of his issues and helping us see him as vulnerable and human. But I feel this book went beyond that and made him seem extremely whiny and needy. He also came off as kind of an idiot. From the very beginning before Tris was even around he purposely took a lesser job than he could have in Dauntless so that he would have access to the technology and codes he would need so he could eventually get out because he knew there was something worth finding outside the fence. He knew something was up with this world they were in. He didn't accept it, or anything, at face value. But now in Allegiant he is willing to go along with some half plotted hair-brained scheme foisted on him by someone he barely knows? After all he's seen? He just kept doing really stupid things that I found irritating and didn't fit with his character. Tris on the other hand became this world wise know it all who was somehow always doing the right thing and always knew what the truth was. She had never questioned anything about her world until the end of Divergent, but now all of a sudden she knows everything about everything and is some kind of human lie detector? I felt like in this book and the last she WAS making judgements based on her feelings (fear, revenge, resentment, jealousy) but she just kept getting lucky in that she happened to be right despite being skewed by her emotions. She started to get on my nerves in Insurgent because of the gun/WIll thing. I get that it's traumatic but when you're in the middle of a battle/war, you can't just give up. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do and I really wanted her step up. She did a little bit in Allegiant. At least she could hold a gun again and stopped whining SO much about Will. I think there was honestly just much too much introspection in Insurgent and Allegiant for me. It slowed the pacing of the books down, made them longer than necessary and bored me. I also couldn't identify with Tris and Tobias' desperate need to please and be accepted by parents who were no longer part of their lives and hadn't been for some time. Of course your parents have an impact on your life and you always love them but at some point don't you move on to living your own life and having more important things to dwell on than what your parents did or didn't do years ago? Neither of them seemed to have trouble cutting all ties to join a different faction and presumably never see their parents again, so why now were they both so consumed with them? Especially when Abnegation families tend to not know each other well or be that close to each other. It was a huge driving force in both their lives respectively and I just couldn't understand why.I do not tend to picky about world building in novels. Make up whatever world you want. But you have to convince me. It has to FEEL plausible. I don't need to know every little detail, you don't have to prove it's actually possible. But I need to buy it, and I didn't buy this one. I was looking forward to finding out what was outside the fence. And we really never did. I mean I know there's the compound and the cities and the experiments and fringe. But....what else? And how does that all fit together? There's NOTHING in the western United States at all anymore? How do people in the cities live? Are there schools? Regular jobs? Hover cars? What about the rest of the WORLD? What happened out there while the US was apparently destroying itself over genetic manipulation? Did that happen everywhere? Why did no one step in? Or come help or invade once we had devastated our own population? What is the US government like now? Is there still a president? A king? A mutant octopus overlord? What? I wanted a much bigger, more cohesive picture than we got. I feel like all we got outside the fence was the compound which they never left, except Tris one time. I kept wondering why no one went outside? AT ALL. Wouldn't you want some fresh air? Who could stay inside a compound indefinitely? I'd go crazy. The constant our leaders are lying, the world isn't what we've been told, we must find out the truth and then REBEL cycle got really repetitive and old too.The genetic modification was an interesting idea, but I don't think it supported the plot like it needed to, and that's where it all fell apart for me. For one, I can't figure out why everyone would buy into such an idea in the first place. What do your genes really have to do with your behavior? But okay, people believe stupid things sometimes, so let's say they do. I don't understand the point or benefit of the city experiments when the entire country is populated by GP and GD people. What were they trying to accomplish there? If you want more GPs just encourage the free GPs to reproduce among themselves. Which would be likely anyway since they hate the GDs. Sterilize or kill off the GDs if you're a terrible power hungry elitist organization bent on their destruction. If they were trying to produce GPs or \"Divergent\" people in the experiments then why did they not remove those that were produced for their own safety instead of leaving them in the experiment to be killed for being Divergent? Why perpetuate the belief that being Divergent was a bad thing when it was actually supposedly the desired outcome of the experiment? And how do a bunch of GD people just randomly all of a sudden start producing GPs? Or how would offspring of the first GD people even have been effected to begin with. Something that is modified on my body is not necessarily going to be passed to my offspring. All the GPs are better, GDs are better back and forth made me feel like I could have just read The Sneetches by Dr. Suess and saved myself some time.I thought SEVEN generations was way way too long for these experiments to have been going on. Seven generations and no one tried to get out? No one questioned this tiny little world they were living in? I know there was one factionless uprising and memory erasure, but why was there never a rebellion? I can't imagine staying in one tiny city my entire life and never trying to find out or wondering what was outside. Also if they had been in there for seven generations then how come no one had any grandparents or great grandparents or really any extended family to speak of at all? And how many people were put in the experiments to begin with? After seven generations of people all stuck in one city wouldn't you start to have some inbreeding going on? I mean there just wouldn't be that many people to chose from.The resolution was unsatisfying for me. Tris exposed the truth to the entire city, which is exactly what David did not want to happen. So I couldn't figure out why he would so immediately and completely trust her. Unless he was maybe setting her up from the beginning. I still don't understand why he was where he was at the end or how he knew to be there or that she would be there when she didn't even know she'd be there. I thought Tris' \"sacrifice\" was completely needless and selfish. She was leaving behind a lot of people who would be damaged and mourn her for the rest of their lives. She didn't need to do that. Not only could she have sent Caleb who, let's face it, was a sociopath who no one liked and who contributed basically nothing good to society. She also based her decision off of beliefs taught to her by a faction that she knew was just a fabrication to cover a government experiment. That doesn't make sense and I don't think it would have pleased her parents who sacrificed their lives so she could LIVE, not die. Of course they sacrificed for her, they're her parents who were middle aged and had lived good lives. They wanted that for their children too. But all that could have been avoided altogether since apparently the only thing needed to stop the uprising in Chicago was for Tobias to go and give his mother an ultimatum. The only reason they were going to drop the memory serum was because they wanted to stop the uprising and create peace so they could keep their experiment going. Which Tobias did without serum simply by awakening some latent mothering instinct in the woman who for most of his life really didn't care about him at all. I do not understand why Evelyn and Marcus would fold and give up their life's work in one moment like that, but it was certainly convenient. Except for for Tris who was erasing the compound's memories anyway. Explain to me why the mostly innocent people in the compound deserved to have their memories erased more than the people in Chicago? The majority of people in the compound were just as innocent and ignorant as the people in the experiment. I did not like the whole memory erasure thing. It didn't feel like justice, or resolution so much as revenge. I think simply assassinating David, in that case, would have made a lot more sense. Erasing the compound's memory did nothing to solve the larger nationwide issue anyway. And what happened to the other experiment cities? Chicago got it's happy ending but what about everyone else?If this book had been more action packed and moved at a faster pace, I don't think I would have had so many questions. I would have been swept along with it much like I was in Divergent and the plot holes might not have bothered me as much once I caught them because I would have enjoyed the experience anyway. Insurgent and Allegiant slowed WAY down from the pace that was set in Divergent. I think both books could have been shorter, with maybe not quite so much repetitive introspection, which gave me time to ponder the other aspects of the plot. Ultimately, I'm disappointed in this book. I would not have finished it if it hadn't been the ending to this series. I think this series had way too much hype and it will end up suffering for that. When I read Divergent way back when it wasn't popular I thought it was a slightly above average, entertaining YA dystopia. Not necessarily the next blockbuster. I think once the media got ahold of it it got blown WAY out of proportion and I'm not sure ANY ending would have stood up to the expectations that were inadvertently set for it.

{"reviewTime": "10 23, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "It is no secret that I love &#34;Divergent&#34;- by the end of the semester of my YA class I am sure that the majority of my classmates (not to mention prof) wanted to pull some Tris-like moves on me for CONSTANTLY pushing it on them. That being said, a lot of that love was unfortunately lost on &#34;Insurgent&#34;, with me feeling that it lost too much of the magic from the previous book- with Tris and Four's relationship constantly balancing precariously over the chasm, Tris refusing to give in any way, shape, or form, and so forth. As such, on the one hand I was beyond excited to read this book (thinking that &#34;Insurgent&#34; merely suffered from second book syndrome and that Veronica would redeem herself), but on the other, I was nervous beyond belief (based upon the previous two books it stood to reason that there would be a lot of conflict, violence, and loss in this)- at times, giving myself a stomach ache when thinking about actually reading it.My biggest worries about this book surrounded its ending because I heard vague whispers that THINGS WENT DOWN- as such, I was convinced before even starting it that I would hate it. However, surprisingly, I did not hate the ending, it wasn't near as hard to accept as I had thought that it would be (Plus, I give mad props to Veronica for doing what she did- it's something that I have literally never seen another author do before, them always chickening out at the last minute. She's going to get a lot of hate for it, but when you really think about it, it totally fits with the overall scheme of things). Furthermore, the last twenty or so pages of this book were absolutely gorgeous- I don't often cry while reading a book, but there was definitely some tearing up going on as I read them. Based on the ending alone, I would give the book 5 stars.Furthermore, I did like the fact that from book to book you can see massive character growth- growth seen in Tris and Four especially (something that really became clear to me as I (re)read all three books in the course of two days). Also, the vulnerability exhibited by all of the characters made them extremely relatable and helped me to understand why they did what they did- even those characters that I swore that I would hate until the end of my days, for instance, Peter and Caleb. Last, I did like the duo POV in this book (I always love me some male POV), however, I can't help but wish that Tris and Four's voices were a bit more ferreted out, it was, at times, difficult to determine whose head you actually were in, since they sounded so similar.That being said, what I did hate about the book, and what did drag down the star rating, was how often Veronica put us through the ringer- with petty, jealous high school drama, further conflict after conflict between Tris and Four (I mean, didn't we get enough of this in &#34;Insurgent&#34;- we get it, relationships are hard and need work, trust isn't a given, and so forth), and an inundated storyline (you thought that the faction system in the first two books was confusing? It's NOTHING compared to all of the layers of politics and whatnot going on in this book- kitchen sink, anyone?). Furthermore, I was not a fan of the pace of the book, the setting of much of it, and I absolutely loathed the new character additions (with the exception of one). Combined, around the 350 page mark, I was about to give up on the book because I was just so angry with everything going on.All in all, for me personally it's a toss-up between three and four stars. Overall, I'm glad that I pushed through and didn't give up on the book. While there is admittedly a part of me does wish that this book did end a different way, as I mentioned, I do think that it is what was truly needed and I appreciate Veronica for having the balls to do so. It's clear that she is the most Dauntless person around.

READ THIS BOOK NOW if you have read DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.  Do NOT look at SPOILERS.  Make your own judgments about this book and the series as a whole.----------------------------Tobias did believe in Tris's judgment at the end of Insurgent and played Jeanine's file for all the citizens to see.  It was a video message from the past stating that the inhabitants were placed there as an experiment and that once the population had a large percentage of people with divergent abilities that would be the time for Amity to allow people to leave their borders, to go to help whomever may be on the outside.It's difficult to say much about this book without revealing what you should read and discover on your own.  There are very minor spoilers here.Evelyn is still ruling the armed factionless and the community as a whole as a dictator.  A secret group of citizens who hold allegiance to the old faction system form with the intent of overthrowing Evelyn.  Tris, Four, Uriah, Christina, Caleb & Peter venture past Amity and make their way to a compound where the government agency responsible for establishing and monitoring the genetic experiments in former Chicago is.  The group have a lot to learn about the compound, their history in the experiment, and the world.  The agency welcomes the group and introduces them to their beliefs and ways.  Tris and Tobias had mended their relationship by the end of Insurgent, but find that with the new territory of the compound comes brand new issues that test them and their relationship.  When they learn the compound scientists intend to meddle with the people in the Chicago experiment in a major way, they must decide if they should take action and if so, what it should be.I enjoyed having the story told in alternating POV's of Tris and Tobias.  In this way we learn what each of them are feeling, withholding, and why.  I think the addition of Tobias' POV adds range to the book.  There were major twists at the end of the book that result in many readers being outraged.  Frankly, I didn't find the biggest twist shocking.  In fact beliefs and decisions throughout the trilogy lead clearly to the twist, in retrospect.  I really believe that Allegiant's big twist and the ending are beautiful, once the surprise wears off.  I loved Allegiant and will be re-reading the whole Divergent series in the future.My favorite quote from the book is from Tris regarding Tobias:\"Just as I have insisted on his worth, he has always insisted on my strength, insisted that my capacity is greater than I believe.  And I know, without being told, that's what love does when it's right- it makes you more than you were, more than you thought you could be.\"", "reviewerName": "AZ Judy \"AZ Judy\"", "summary": "I LOVED ALLEGIANT INCLUDING SURPRISE TWISTS AND RECOMMEND YOU READ IT AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK.", "helpful": [3, 7], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383436800, "reviewerID": "AFSTSLFH8LX6A"}

Her prose barely rises above the complexity of \"See spot run\", and her endless repetition of the same weary adjectives makes me fervently hope someone buys her a thesaurus for Christmas. I am similarly underwhelmed by her ham-handed use of point of view. The previous two books were written solely from the point of view of Tris while this book's point of view alternates between Tris and Tobias. Roth's plain Jane, junior high style prose never achieves a difference in voice between her own narration, Tris, or Tobias. This is especially disappointing because Tobias is such a complex, mysterious character and should have delivered riveting chapters. The finale is the most monotone book I have ever had the misfortune of reading, and if you're perceptive, you realize early on why she has to write from the perspective of two characters. Many people are howling about the ending, and while I maintain it was not the ending I hoped for, my opinion is that Roth is too poor and weak of a writer to achieve the shocking, hard-hitting ending she desired. Never mind all the intricate plots, subplots, and endless revolutions. She couldn't achieve resolution. You could argue that not all dystopian futures will be  or have to be resolved and that her book is actually realistic, but given the scores of weaknesses throughout the book, I'm going to guess that Roth couldn't tie up her loose ends.I'm not sure what happened to the most anticipated young adult novel of the year, but my primary theory is that having released three novels in three years and a slew of forthcoming Divergent-related short stories, Roth was really just looking to cash in big while she could.

They were great; wonderful exciting stories, and some awesome characters, especially Tris and Tobias.  I could not wait for this final book, and to see how Roth was going to end it all.  I discussed this with a few friends, who read this series based on my recommendation.Allegiant to me was a major disappointment.  It just wasn't the same, with the book being very slow early on, as well as the constant redundancy.  I also did not like the POV's that Roth decided to add into this book, which made it so different then the first.  It was almost like a different writer.What drew me to this series were the young protagonists we met, as well as the exciting action throughout.  All of this was missing for the most part.  As much as I loved Tobias, the main character for this series, the one who we followed through it all, was Tris.  She was a fantastic character, strong, smart, tough, and would make a fearless leader. In fact, in this book, I thought Tobias was no where near as strong as Tris.  The best part of the book, despite its climatic ending, was the epilogue.  Roth wrote this well....a nice tribute.SPOILERS ......SPOILERS.....SPOILERS(Do not go past this point if you have not read this book, unless you want to spoiled)I have been a big fan of this series, and loved VR's writing.  But after reading Allegiant, and this is solely my opinion....I was sadly disappointed, as I did not feel this was the same author who wowed us in the first two books.We became invested into these characters.  We loved Tris and Tobias.  We get it...it's a war. People have to die.  It's reality.  But this is fiction; we read and imagine with you the excitement of the battles, the love, the friendships.......the ending game.I totally understand that sacrifices have to be made in a story like this.  VR did make them all throughout.  But to take a main character, and sacrifice that character is not what we invested in.  I wasn't totally thrilled with the ending of the Hunger Games, but Katniss would eventually rebuild her life with someone who loved her.  She made her sacrifices, and paid the price, but she survived.Was it necessary to kill Tris off, especially when she survived the serum? What was the point of risking her life (to save a brother who betrayed her), suffering, surviving, and then killing her needlessly, other then to shock us all?  She deserved more, as in real life how many people would offer their lives?Again, this is my opinion. Divergent was great, more then great.  Insurgent was very good, though a tad less then the first book.

It sounds like Ms. Roth ended it the way she planned all along. And, it was her story to tell--I admire her storytelling abilities and wish I had an iota of her writing talent. Just because you don't like how it ends, it shouldn't ruin the fact that the series overall has all the elements of a solid, well told story--full of interesting ideas, action, wonderfully crafted characters, romance, questions of right and wrong, and great character development.

I will admit, for me it was not as great as Divergent or Insurgent, but I still really liked it.I thought it lacked the same on the edge of your seat action and suspense of the previous two books. Also, the romance between Tobias and Tris was frustrating and heart breaking, they just did not connect in the same way, there was something missing, but at the same time, that is the ebb and flow of relationship.I would have loved a happy ending, I am a sap for happy endings and really don't like to read a book that doesn't have that ending where you smile and sigh and feel like it is all wrapped up with a nice little bow on top. If you are hard core in this belief, unwavering in your need for the nice ending, please do not read this book.I never dreamed the series would finish in this way, it literally left me sobbing into my pillow, with a feeling of emptiness and resignation. It almost seemed like the fighting and the sacrifices, the loss and the pain were for naught. However, that is not the case. There is a new start. Pieces are picked up, life goes on. There is no such thing as a utopian society. No such thing as perfection. The fight was fought and a victory won, even with great sacrifice.So Veronica Roth, good job. Good job with a realistic ending, one that teaches that there is life after heartache, through heartache. That we must go on and make the best of any situation.

It's sad and heart wrenching, and though I was skeptical to read it at first because I knew this book was receiving such terrible reviews, it was definitely worth my time. Everyone was so upset about the main character dying. I can think of hundreds of great stories of a main character dying. Not to mention that Tris has had a death wish since book 1, all along the way Tris has always been willing to sacrifice herself for others. How did we not see her death coming? And besides, I believe Veronica Roth gave Tris a very honorable death.My only complaint is that I wish Tris had a more grandiose death with many knowing the sacrifice she made to change the society and not just the few people that knew. I also would have preferred her death to not happen immediately after she survived the death serum. I wanted more time to sit with that a moment, that she survived something that no one else has ever survived. It shows how incredibly remarkable Tris Prior is... was.I know alot of people are also upset because of Evelyn's choice at the end, that there is simply no way she would have made that decision. We don't really get to see Evelyn much in this book, but its clear she is distraught over Tobias leaving and we see her on more than one occasion upset. I think her moving away from the factions and choosing Tobias makes sense, even if it kind of felt like it came from no where. We don't see much of her, so how do we really know what internal struggles she's having in this book or whether she's being sincere in choosing Tobias?And Tobias... my heart aches for him. But I feel Veronica Roth gave us just enough time to grieve Tris dying and also enough time see Tobias begin to heal. It gives us hope!I think alot of people need to look pass the fact that the main character died. The author herself has stated that this book ended exactly how she envisioned it ending before she even started writing the first book. Look at the deeper picture in the story. Veronica Roth delivers some very powerful and beautiful messages in her story.Be brave.\"Damaged\" is just a term and doesn't define who you are.The choices you make defines who you are and one choice can make all the difference.Don't let someone sacrifice themselves for you if it's not out of love. If you need to sacrifice yourself do it for the right reasons. Do it out of love. Do it to make a difference. Do it to because it's going to change the world.You don't have to belong to a faction, or to a city, or to a government. But belonging to a family, belonging to friends, that makes all the difference. You belong to them, and they belong to you.

{"reviewTime": "04 5, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I will try not to give away anything about the book in this review (at least major things).First, I LOVED Divergent. I didn't think I would, I thought the entire premise of the novel was dumb. Veronica Roth did an excellent job selling that premise to her readers and the book was a good story start to finish. I couldn't put it down. A group of girls in my 8th grade class chose Divergent for their dystopian literature unit and they all loved it and read the entire series. Some of these were girls who did not love to read. So that is something.Insurgent was hard for me to get into, but by the end, I really liked that book as well. I was mostly mad at Tris for being such a moron, but then, that was okay. She's a teenage girl who was recently orphaned and her entire world has been turned upside down for many reasons. I get that, and by the end things got better. But one of the problems with Allegiant can be explained here. Tris was being an idiot, but I already loved her from Divergent that she got a pass.Allegiant- well, this book has some serious shortcomings. I do not like that she changed the point of view on this book. We (readers) got to know Tris from the beginning, we knew her inner workings- her flaws and strengths well enough that her point of view only continued to help us love her more as she continued to tell her side of the story. Adding Tobias in as a narrator at the very end of the series- and only for half of the book was an odd shift that by itself changed the tone of the story. Additionally, Roth jumps right in with Tobias's narrative and character. We don't get to know his perspective as deeply as we get to know Tris. He goes from this amazing solid support for Tris to this completely sullen brat. And because we didn't get to know him other than what we knew from Tris's lovestruck view of him, I didn't have as much love for him as I did for Tris when she was being the same way. Changing the format didn't help readers buy into all the other direction changes and plot twists that were thrown at them in this novel.This novel went into so many different directions that it lost its focus, which also lost my interest. I really think my three star rating comes from the fact that I loved Divergent and really liked Insurgent.Aside from the narration problems that intterrupt the flow of the novel, there is the problem of the plot. Everything we thought to be true about Tris's Chicago is stripped down and thrown away. She spent two novels spinning it one way and then completely turns it around in the third book and that happens just about immediately.I don't want to give anything away, but there is no set rule book about killing off major players in a series. All the memes about George RR Martin, JK Rowling, Suzanne Collins, Joss Whedon and Steven Moffatt are just jokes. Roth didn't need to take that &#34;advice&#34; to heart. It made an already difficult book to love irredeemable. Additionally, it is possible to write a book with a message without slamming them in the head with the book every time the reader turns the page. Give them your evidence and let the reader make their own conclusion. If not- your book will sound preachy and condescending, which this book certainly borders on that line.What I did love: This book has some great observations, and great quotable sections of the book. (It is currently on loan to a student or I would love to share some.)

My favorite characters were Tris & Tobias. I think Veronica Ross captured the essence of young love and the roller coaster of emotions that fly high. Somehow, this young couple figured out that there is no magical \"happy ever after\". Everything in life is a choice whether it's to forgive or to love.

Despite some of the faults I found with the book, overall I really felt it was truly a great conclusion to this series.Blurb from Goodreads:One choice will define you.What if your whole world was a lie?What if a single revelation&#8212;like a single choice&#8212;changed everything?What if love and loyalty made you do things you never expected?The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered&#8212;fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she&#8217;s known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.But Tris&#8217;s new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human nature&#8212;and of herself&#8212;while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.In the hopes of keeping this review spoiler free, I am pretty sure it's going to be shorter than most of what I write.If you want a book that is going to totally tug at your heart strings and make your feelings fly all over the place, then I'm pretty sure this book will hit the mark.The character development in this one is fantastic. My favorite part was actually getting inside Tobias's (Four's ) head. For the longest time we saw Four through Tris's eyes, and as we all know that can't really show us what a character is truly about. Having Four reveal to us what he's thinking, feeling, wanting, was just incredible and really gave a whole new flavor to this series.As for Tris, she kind of annoyed me in this book. As usual she's a bit selfish, always thinking that she's thinking of others but never actually doing it. It was a bit frustrating, but I think all in all she was coming from a good place and really wanted to the best for everyone she loved.The plot, well it's certainly a twist I was not expecting. I have read a few dystopian's recently that took this turn of events, but not in such a way that kept me totally enthralled. The explanation for the factions, how they were formed and why, it totally turned me around and had me walking backward! I was not expecting it. And the pacing was perfect. I was never bored, I always wanted more and I really didn't want to put the book down.There is so much controversy over how Roth decided to end this series. And, while it broke my heart to read the things she wrote, I give her so much credit for going there and doing what she needed she felt to do to bring this saga to a close. It's artistic license and it's amazing. Will people hate her for it, sure. Will people understand her for it, some will some won't. But it really doesn't matter in the long run what others think because it's what was necessary in her eyes and that's what really matters. The chance she takes is amazing and I totally get down on bended knee and praise her for it!Here is my thought to those who are upset: It's a DYSTOPIAN world, things cannot be perfect, having a happily ever after is UNREALISTIC and if you feel like that's what you want, perhaps reading a different sub-genre would be more your style. Roth truly hurt me with this book, but it was necessary. Recently I have been let down by the ends of the trilogies I have been reading. They have not met my expectations at all. But this book, well, this one shot me right back to wanting to read trilogies again.Bravo Ms. Roth.

{"reviewTime": "01 20, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Divergent and Insurgent were amazing. Hard to put down, I neglected my house duties just to read that book. Browsing the grocery store, my thoughts were to get home and devour the rest of those books as quickly as possible. If it were available as a drug, I probably would have Divergent and Insurgent IV'd straight to my veins. Dramatic? Yes.Sadly as my shaking hands opening Allegiant and started to read it, I really felt as though I was coming down after a great adrenaline rush. This is the direction she chose to end the series?! Really? There are numerous reasons but the following pertain most to my opinions...1. STAY TRUE TO YOUR CHARACTERS! In Insurgent Tobias (Four) foot stomps his Dad in the middle of the cafeteria to prove he's not a coward or a 'pansycake'. In Allegiant we find Tobias crying in the corner sucking his thumb. With the technology available in the books, couldn't he get an injection to help with his manic depression? Why would he go from one extreme to the other? Caleb went from being extremely smart in Erudite to a window licker with breakfast sauce on his shirt. VR, please, please get to know your characters and play true to their personalities. While reading, I kept thinking 'WTF'? The characters wouldn't go down like that.2. TRAGEDY WORKS, ONLY IF WRITTEN CORRECTLY. There were times when I was reading and could tell that VR's thoughts were 'Welp, time for someone to die! Bang, bang'. And that was it. Someone would hit the floor or ground and it was supposed to be 'tragic'. Followed by this weird sense of a relative to emerge from the dead and be struck by grief. I'm sorry, not boo hoo sad, it was 'WTF'? Once again.3. TAKE A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. This book could have gone in soooo many different directions. She could have created more of the thrilling, suspenseful and great love plot that was evident in the first two books. Instead VR took a weird, all together nonsensical direction that didn't work. I love The Giver and Pleasantville, infact, dystopic and utopic society stories are by far my favorite. However, the direction that VR took made no sense to me. These people were living LITERALLY right down the street from a gov't facility that was keeping tabs on them and had no clue?4. NO LOOSE ENDS WERE TIED UP. Seriously. None. See above. So many characters were developed in the first two books and then as an aside were just quickly disposed of. Keep going with the characters from the first two books, no new characters were really needed. She created this wonderful foundation to build this book on and really just said 'Meh'. Know your audience and what they want...I'm sure she couldn't give a crap, VR's probably wiping her butt with all the cash she made off of this book.By and large, I was angry, hurt and just plain dumbfounded that this was how the series ended. I felt as though VR stayed up late all night and wrote some drivel that wasn't even half coherent. It makes me sad too, that the publisher allowed the book to be put on stands this way. I'm sad that these characters weren't given the true justice they deserved to be developed and really saw through to the end.", "reviewerName": "bibliophilic \"Sara\"", "summary": "Ugh, Reall?

I had been anxiously awaiting its arrival; annoying everyone in my family by counting the days. Its taken me a week to formulate and digest my thoughts enough to be able to write this review.Let me start by saying I LOVED Divergent! I thought the characters were well developed. For a middle book in a trilogy, Insurgent was better than most.I did not like Allegiant.My dislike is not based at on the twist ending. I enjoy stories that surprise me. An ending that is not your typical happy ending or even an ending that I disagree with makes me think and analyze and question. My dislike is solely based on the writing.The choice to write from alternate points of view is tricky and Roth did not do it well. The voice of each character did not shine through. I very often found myself having to re-check the beginning of  each chapter to see whose POV it was. There was no distinguishing voice between Tris and Tobias.I also felt the writing was boring. The short sentences that flowed so well and were so engaging in the previous two books, fell short in this one. There was not flow to the story and it seemed very repetitive and dull. The word choice was basic and boring.The story itself was repetitive, uprise-share the truth-overthrow, and the plot twist at the beginning involving the United Comonwealth was very contrived. I found myself muttering, &#34;Are you kidding me?!?&#34; many times.I am disappointed  that such an anticipated novel was such a spectacular disaster. My disappointment had me asking many questions. Were the first two books flukes? Did the popularity of the first two go to her head? Was she too focused on the making of the movie? Did she want to distance herself from the wildly popular series? Did Roth actually write this book???Whatever the answers, I know that I cannot recommend this book to anyone. With that being said, when I am advising on what great books to read, I will still recommend Divergent and Insurgent.

I know that it will be a very wrecking ending. Though it did not make me sob, I think that it was still so sad. And just one thing, I think I get it why it happened like that.Veronica made sure that the book would get all the right things it should have; she did not listen to the fans who want every little fantasy they want to happen; she made it really her own story and no one could tell her what to do, which I believe each author should learn from, BUT, there's a big BUT here, people anticipated, waited and begged for it for a year and they ended up tearing and breaking, on bended-knees of why , why, why it turned out that way.AAAAAARGGGH... I can't put into proper words how I really felt when reading the book.There were times that the feeling was intense and there were times that the feeling was just not it! I was disappointed actually. I expected a lot and maybe that also made other people get mad. We expected a LOT from it.But what made me love it is that it was a big twist. Although it was not more of &#34;Allegiant&#34;, it was more of the world outside, where EVERYTHING IS ALL EXPLAINED HOW EVERYTHING TURNED OUT FROM THE FIRST BOOK TO THE SECOND BOOK.( I am trying to lift up souls here so that you should read this ending but when you read lots of reviews around the web, it would be hard for you to do it. )OH GOSH, Tris is just so stupid. I believe she is so stupid but NO, I believe it was for the betterment of the people in the city. Caleb was more of a douche, but I still feel sad for him.

{"reviewTime": "11 17, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "SPOILER FREE!First, let me say that this was a lot easier to read than &#8216;Insurgent.&#8217; When reading a series, I usually do not go back and re-read the other novels (&#8216;Harry Potter&#8217; is an exception) because I just don&#8217;t have time with my grading load, but I HAD to re-read parts of &#8216;Divergent&#8217; in order to read &#8216;Insurgent,&#8217; which I did not like. This is not the case with the final installment.I was able to pick up the novel and read and remember everything from the previous book with no issue.Readers are thrust back into Tris&#8217; Chicago, one full of corruption, one on the brink of total chaos. There is a fight for power as those who prefer a Faction life seem lost in the cracks to those who do not. But this is the least of Tris&#8217; worries.Tris and Tobias reunite and decide it is time for outside intervention. It is time to see what is on the other side of the fence. The consequences are great, and the world discovered sends both Tris and Tobias into a tailspin. The question is, can they survive it&#8212;and can they find true meaning within their own lives?Roth really had me with this novel. I read the entire story in one day. I could not put it down. I had to see where she was taking me, and where she was going to leave our beloved Tris and Tobias.If you are a fan of the series, you cannot miss this conclusion to the tale. I do not care what you have read/heard/seen, etc. You have to read and experience it for yourself.With that said, I do have a few issues with the novel. There were several holes in the storytelling that were never answered. But I do have a theory: those holes were just a distraction to where Roth was leading us. While I have those questions, I feel as if I have enough of the story to fill in those holes myself. I just don&#8217;t always like to do it.I was so torn about this novel when I finished it. I could not reach out to my fellow readers if they had not yet read it&#8212;but I could reach out to the hubby. So, I asked him to read it so we could discuss the ending. He read it. Then he said, &#8220;You had me read that book and now we aren&#8217;t going to discuss it?!&#8221; That man.While I read a story of love and friendship, he re-read &#8216;Insurgent.&#8217; He felt as if Roth just re-wrote the second novel in a different setting. This is what I want to ask you all: did you feel the same way? I did, and I didn&#8217;t at the same time. If that makes sense.But, he and I agreed on the ending&#8212;and without spoiling it here, let me just say that we both believe it was not the ending for this novel. I have spoken to several of my students and fellow teachers who have read the novel, and they side with us on this as well.But, I do not regret reading the series. At all. I really enjoy Tris and Tobias as separate characters, but I really enjoy when they are on the page together. Roth has a nice pacing to her storytelling, and while she is not a master at world building, she doesn&#8217;t need to. In this series, she shows how easily the world can be torn apart, a world that many of us already live in&#8212;in a metaphorical sense.If you are a fan of &#8216;The Hunger Games&#8217; series but you have yet to pick up the &#8216;Divergent&#8217; series, this is the perfect time to do it.

{"reviewTime": "12 4, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "SPOILER ALERTThis book falls way short of the series. Divergent was compelling and fast paced and I loved the momentum. Insurgent, in my opinion, was not as good as the first. I felt like I was stuck with 500 pages of being in Tris' emotional, and nervous, breakdown. It was not as fast paced as the first. Unfortunately, the this book does little to mitigate the second book slump of Insurgent. In fact, Roth never should have written this.First there is the differing POVs.  We constantly switch between Tris' and Tobias' viewpoint. I hate books with differing POV. I won't read them. I only read Allegient because I wanted to know how the series would end. Unfortunately, I had to keep going back to the chapter beginning to find out whose head I was in.  Also, the sudden change to differing viewpoints disrupts the continuity of the first two books, which were told from Tris' POV.Also, Tris just doesn't seem to be as strong of a character in this book. I miss her strength and defiance from the first. She also has the annoying habit of always being right. She tells Tobias to stay away from Nita because Nita is using. Of course, Tobias doesn't listen to Tris and decides to trust someone he doesn't know, which made little sense, and then apologizes to Tris later saying that he should have listened to her.  And then there is the fact that Tobias is a weak willed pansy. In Divergent h had a strength that help Tris and fueled her own admirable qualities. But by book three I felt he was nothing but a mopey whiner.None of the characters really followed the traits Roth set them up with in the first two books.  And the resolution made no sense.  Evelyn is a mass murdering little B***.  As she plans to destroy the factions and seize control of Chicago, Tobias decides to have a talk with her. After pages of boring conversation Evelyn decides not to kill people and to become a good person.  The same with Marcus.  In the first two books, Marcus is a prick.  He wants to take over the world, or at least the city of Chicago. However, Johanna talks him out of it with pages of boring conversation.  She says, you shouldn't. It wouldn't be right.\"  And Marcus basically goes, \"Okay.\"  And that's the end of that. Seriously?  Such actions don't follow the character's personalities and made for a lackluster ending.Then there is Tris' death. I am normally okay with the main character dying as long as it is done right. Their death has to make sense and Tris' didn't, nor was it necessary.  Since Evelyn and Marcus decided not to kill people, why did Tris have to die? She goes into the weapons lab, ingest the death serum, which doesn't kill her because she is somehow immune to it, but that's okay because a bullet finished the job.  The only reason Tris went into the weapons lab was to save Caleb, and to stop the U.S. government from using the death serum to kill innocent people, even though she had no proof that such a thing would ever happen.Rothalso finally explains why Chicago is split into factions and which lies outside, but none of it made much sense. Apparently, the U.S. government decide to mess with genetics to make people a certain way, but it didn't go right. So they wanted to get genetically pure people, by setting up an experiment in Chicago.  And for a few generations, Chicago lives in their own little world while everything they do is filmed by secret cameras and watched by people on the outside.  So, yeah, when the mass murder in Divergent happens, apparently people outside the city were watching it and eating popcorn.  The majority of the book was spent with people talking about genetically inferior people and genetically pure people. It dragged.  In fact, I started skipping pages. I also felt that the explanation of the Tris' world was not well thought out and just thrown in there.Then there is Caleb.  He betrays Tris in book two and remains the coward in this one. He should hve either died with Tris, or at least been with her when she died. Instead, she sacrifices herself for him, something she would do, and he runs away without even trying to stop her.I also had a problem with Peter and Marcus taking the memory serum. They get to forget everything they had done and live a better life elsewhere.  Where's the justice?And lastly, the writing quality.  Roth's writing skills are by no means stellar. I'm not trying to insult her, it's just her writing reminds me too much of the papers I wrote while in high school. A lot of pople write with the same level of skill she does.  Proper writing is not taught in school.  That being said, I was able to ignore the writing style in Divergent because the book moved, and I found myself wrapped up in Tris' world. But in Insurgent, the book moved more slowly and I could not ignore the writing style. The same for Allegiant. This book is not fast paced. the middle is boring. It felt like she only stuck in an action scene so she could kill off a character. Because of this, I could not ignore the average writing style and I stopped caring about the characters.  What made me love the characters in Divergent did not exist in Allegiant.This book was just a huge disappointment. I was hoping for a better ending, especially one that made sense. I felt like she threw the ending together while at the same time trying to see how many pages she could write.

I was expecting something a bit more fleshed out and elaborate than what was. Something a bit more grand and stunning. Also, I have to agree with another reviewer who wrote about the alternating narrative. Tris and Tobias' voices were not distinctly different from one another. At times, I couldn't remember who was speaking until they mentioned the other, so that was a bit annoying. Overall, though, it was a satisfying ending to the series.

This book is the weakest of the three (just like Mockingjay and Requiem) but I still thoroughly enjoyed it, start to finish!Yes, the plot gets convoluted (and I did care more about the conflict between the factions than the whole GP/GD battle), and the genetic damage issue requires a LOT of suspension of disbelief...but I'm ok with that! I read for the fantasy, for the escape, not for the science! Yes, the ending is controversial, and tore my heart out. But I also felt like it was completely in keeping with the character's previous actions, and therefore while I wanted to curse and throw things I had to sigh and allow the sad acceptance to settle in...this was the correct ending. It hurts, but I can't argue with it. My ability to accept this ending (with only a few tears shed) backs up my claim that I would have accepted a tragic ending from Requiem over the &#34;non-ending&#34; that we got.I really enjoyed the alternating POVs - and Four is one of my favorite book boyfriends ever! He's just *sigh* perfect. I though the character development continued to be a strong suit in this book (as it was in the first two), although there were too many minor characters introduced for that to be true across the board. In fact, if I have one complaint, it's that there were just too many characters and not enough time to understand or develop feelings for them all.The writing, as with the first two books, was just phenomenal for me! Here are just a few of the quotes that made me stop and type status updates:&#34;I'm not sure when, or if, anything will ever get better, not sure if these wounds are the kind that can heal.&#34;~Tris&#34;I wonder if this is how it is with all evil men, that to someone they look just like good men, talk like good men, are just as likable as good men.&#34;~Tris&#34;I know that change is difficult, and comes slowly, and that it is the work of many days strung together in a long line until the origin of them is forgotten. He is afraid that he will not be able to put in that work, that he will squander those days, and that they will leave him worse off than he is now. And I understand that feeling - I understand being afraid of yourself.&#34;~Four&#34;There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes bravery involves laying down your life for something bigger than yourself, or for someone else. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved, for the sake of something greater.But sometimes it doesn't.Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life.That is the sort of bravery I must have now.&#34;~FourI have said it a thousand times, but I will just keep saying it!!

Last book in the series often have a lot of expectations and I think you can't please all the fans out there. A happy ending is not always the best ending. That's my point. The best ending is an ending with an impact on the readers.I am quite amazed at how I avoided all the spoilers for this book. I just know that something happened and a lot did not like it.When I was reading the book, the feeling I get throughout it was depressed and sad in a good way. Some part of me always like this kind of aura when reading the books (just like what I felt when I read Thirteen Reasons Why)All the revelations we had been anticipating for is really consistent with all of the events and mystery that the previous books had. What I like about it is that Veronica Roth had done her research and even though it had a lot of scientific terminologies, it was easy to understand. (at least for me, it will always be a case to case basis)Emotions were always running high and I can empathize with the characters on what they are feeling. The only problem I had was how Four was inconsistent with some parts. But I think the explanation for this is that we finally see how truly vulnerable Four is. Not that I did not see it from his fears on previous books and also things related to Tris, but this time, it is on a bigger picture. Not just him or Tris, but it involves the world around him.And as I said earlier, the ending really had an impact on me. I was crying I think or teary-eyed about what happened.

My friend and I have tried relentlessly to get our other friends to read Divergent. Reading this book, I REALLY wish that I didn't even START reading the series, but, boredom in Taos when your family is on a ski trip miles away from your friends who have \"other plans\" can't be helped.So, I have been amazingly excited for this book.The plot (at the beginning)was the same sort of thing as the other books in the series. The \"perfect\" faction system is being disrupted by something/one, and it needs to be fixed. In the first book, it was Jeanine Matthews who was the criminal. In the second, it was the huge number of Dauntless traitors and the Erudite. In this one, well, I'm not saying anything.I was fascinated with the idea of telling some of the story from Tobias's point of view at the beginning, but when I got to the end of the book, I can see why it was necessary. Another thing that I was intrigued by was Tris's mother's backstory. I thought that it was well- written, and it had some things in it that I didn't even expect. I mean, yeah, just before it was revealed, I saw it coming, but it answered questions that I don't think that ANYONE would think of asking.The main attraction for me, as a 14 year-old girl, was the love story. My best friend in the entire universe (a.k.a the girl who introduced me to this series) would just call me crazy. She really doesn't like love stories. Anyway, the love story was really good in this book, but it does get a little bit mature at one point. There wasn't much detail put in it (thank goodness), but, I definitely would not recommend that children 11 and younger should read that scene. There was also a LOT more kissing in this book than in the others (*giggling because I am NOT telling my best friend about that, and I'm going to be evil and make her find out on her own*), which I was glad about, considering the end of the book.And now, for the last (and definitely most least that you can get) point I'm going to make. *clears throat and drinks some water* All right, here goes: WHY THE HECK DID YOU DO THAT, VERONICA ROTH??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Outside the boundary they discover a reality that is more disturbing than what they left behind. Their whole life until now has been a lie and no one can be trusted. Can Tris face incredible choices about love and loss when everything she knows has been stripped away?In Allegiant, Roth investigates the profound themes of courage, allegiance, and sacrifice. Tris and Tobias must have courage to jump into the unknown and fight for what they believe in. They need to risk everything they know to discover what lies beyond the fence. They must have allegiance to their cause. They must show love with every sacrifice.

The token gay relationship is finally thrown in for no apparent reason except public pressure.  But there is more, much more, going on here:The only loving, caring relationship in the series is Beatrice' mother and father, both slaughtered to define the fact this is an historical relationship - none of the current characters has a normal loving relationship.The genetically pure vs genetically damaged schism is a mirror to what is really going on - we are never quite convinced that the genetically damaged are not, in fact, genetically damaged.  After going to some length to explain how meddling with genetics produced a large number of sociopaths and misfits, primarily male, we are then expected to jump to the conclusion that, in fact, nothing was really the matter with anybody in the end - it's all just a misunderstanding.To continue on the males: every male central to the plot is sociopathic, cruel, violent and manipulative: Marcus (mark us) is irredeemably evil and even our hero Tobias is \"broken\" inside - whether as a result of genes or memes we cannot tell but he constantly fights the same violent impulses as his father.  Beatrice cannot be allowed to live after making a choice inconsistent with the matriarchal theme of the series: Tobias.  Caleb is a coward, Eric is cruel, the only solution for Peter and David is a brain wipe.A series of matriarchs beginning with the mothers of each hero and including Jeanine, Johanna, Tori and the stern old single mother of Uriah and Zeke (who are Compliant males: smiley, happy, non-confrontational) dominate the story with the message that a non-violent matriarchy is the solution to all our problems, not tampering with genetics.  Men who do not comply are to be controlled through whatever coercive means are available, authoritarianism is preferred, not overt violence - thus Jeanine, Tori and ultimately Beatrice are killed off for resorting to violence and Johanna is left in a position of influence with Tobias, head shaved like a monk, shuffling around as her apprentice and acolyte.It is a deft representation of current ultrafeminist theory - not feminism where men and women are equal, but a matriarchal point of view where women are superior and men to be controlled through coercion and manipulation - or culled, if necessar. The destruction of the modern family through abortion, adultery, divorce and propaganda keeps violent men from passing on their genes or at least their ideas and traditions, so that we can all live in an Amity compound where mother knows best.  If we can't keep these men from breeding, at least we can take their kids away from them to stop them passing on their ideas, traditions and weaknesses.Veronica Roth has created a remarkable vehicle for spreading this ideology - sort of a Berenstein Bears for the YA market - it is difficult to tell whether it is deliberate or whether she is simply a product of several generations of programming.", "reviewerName": "Brett Blaikie", "summary": "Genetic Selection and the Matriarchy", "helpful": [1, 1], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1402531200, "reviewerID": "A2SYWVS7M4ZYO"}

First, I could not tell the difference between the viewpoints of Tris and Tobias. I continually had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to remember from who's point of view I was reading.

For example, Tris, the heroine, decides that to stop the horrible act of the Bureau erasing everyone's memories, she will simply erase all of theirs? Makes sense. Evelyn gives up all power and desire to lead because Tobias asks nicely and Marcus willingly surrenders leading because Johanna asks? I don't think so. And even if that specific Bureau has their memories erased, the rest of the Bureaus in the country do not! So, it is not going to fix anything anyway. As a result, Tris dies for nothing. Honestly, I like when books do not have a happy ending (&#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34;) because it is realistic, but there needs to be a point! And what happened to Tobias? I didn't even recognize him in this book. The strong, smart, observant leader crumbles into someone unrecognizable. Finally, worst of all, the information we discovered in this book made everything that previously happened pointless. Tris' mother died to release a video that meant nothing? Great. The Bureau and Abnegation had memory serum the whole time, but no one used it on Jeanine when she was killing masses of people? Sure. Divergent means nothing? Awesome.

I want to write a lot but I will never have enough time to write what all I think went wrong with this book. I'm finding it hard to think of any other series ending I have been so disappointed in.This final book felt rushed. It actually seemed like someone who didn't know the characters wrote this book. The duel POVs did not work. I think by giving us Tobias's perspective, she actually took away his voice. This Tobias didn't seem anything like the one in the previous books.The whole underlying meaning of the series of being Divergent (I mean, come on, it's the title of your first book Roth), just vanishes. It's kinda like oh, being divergent is genetic so you aren't anything special and what you have done isn't special.I usually never agree with killing off a main character but I don't mind when it adds something and provides meaning. This death was just wrong in so many ways. First off, it was too rushed and almost like an after thought. I feel like it was added for shock value but honestly wasn't shocking at all. It was just annoying. This book made me dislike Tris at times before her death but I really disliked her after. She took away Caleb's redemption. It made sense for him to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Having her take that away from him just proved that Tris had not grown as a character. She did choose to sacrifice herself regardless if what she told Caleb to tell Tobias. If Tobias was really \"her family now\" and \"she wanted to choose to live,\" then she would have let Caleb do it. Oh, but Tris is always right. Sorry for the rant but I just am really annoyed by her now.Overall, I think the author had a great idea and wrote 2 great books.

{"reviewTime": "11 3, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I think it would be impossible for me to review this book without spoilers, so fair warning, THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!//////Okay, I have read quite a few reviews on this book now, so I'd like to add my two cents. I have been a fan of the Divergent series from the beginning. Any time someone asks for a book recommendation, it is always up there at the top of my list. But after reading Allegiant, I don't know if I can continue recommending it.I feel like the author was rushed into finishing this book. Because she has a much larger fan base than she did with the first and second books, I'm sure there was more pressure on her to finish it. I was happy with the book until about a third of the way through it. Once Tris started learning the \"secrets\" from beyond the fence, the story just lost me. Too many serums, too many simulations, too many conspiracies. I liked the idea of their community (and others) being a sociological experiment. But I don't understand why the genetic cause/pure vs damaged/etc. had to come into it. Why couldn't it simply have been that our society was so far gone that these communities had been set up to salvage and hopefully improve what was left of humankind??I also felt that there were far too many new characters introduced this time around without enough character development. I didn't feel any sort of attachment to anyone that wasn't already from Divergent/Insurgent. They all just seemed flat to me.Now, I have read a lot of criticism of both the double pov and Four's character in general. After reading Roth's short stories from Tobias' perspective, I actually appreciated seeing things from his side. However, I do agree that the two voices were very similar. I sometimes got 3 or 4 pages in before I realized the narrator had changed. As for Four being \"whiny\" or \"wimpy\" in Allegiant--I agree that he appeared to have lost some of his spark. But come on, cut the guy a break. Not everyone can be a super dauntless all the time...Now finally, the ending. Why, why, why? I have read Veronica Roth's explanation on her blog, but I still feel it was unnecessary to kill Tris.  I know her journey was about learning to be both brave and selfless. That, as opposed to in Insurgent, she really did value her life and have the desire to live. But I think it's crap that she died! Why not allow Caleb the opportunity at the end to finally redeem himself and take the bullet for her after she had overcome the death serum? Couldn't that have served the purpose of her learning to be selfless while giving him the chance to show he still loved her?I adore Veronica Roth and loved the series, but I really, really feel she got this one wrong. So in my head, I have changed the ending to the way I think it should be. And Tobias and Tris work together to restore balance in their city.

{"reviewTime": "11 23, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Original review here: [...]Since 2011, youth across the country have been fascinated and enthralled with Veronica Roth's bestselling series, Divergent. In a world full of YA fiction ranging from questionable to downright preachy, Roth brings new elements to the table: a lovely balance of realism and enveloping storytelling one can't help but fall in love with.The story begins with Tris and Four making discoveries about their city that no one ever even had an inkling about. The two warring sides clash immediately, and the ensuing danger leaves Tris and Four with critical decisions to make. Decisions about the massive revelations and the impending war inside the city's fence threaten to throw off their entire existence, but then dire circumstances force them to go outside the fence in search of what lies beyond.Veronica Roth moves her plot along nicely. So nicely, in fact, that I personally mourn the loss of skill and talent in today's YA market-or the market in general. Roth carries about herself a presence of knowledge: knowledge of her world, her characters, her own identity and skill level. Each tier of certainty shines through until I forgot I was reading a work of fiction. The world and plot build up organically, like a mental pop-up book. This being the end of a trilogy, part of me was incredibly hesitant to get to the end. The vast majority of series suffer from Bad Ending Syndrome (BES), where, for reasons unknown, the author throws anything they can together to pull all the loose threads into a cord that quickly frays and reveals the haste-waste. Roth came around with the origins of her world without missing a beat, and by the end of the book, I felt whole and complete, like I had missed nothing and everything had fallen together. That being said, parts in the middle did lag a bit; plot-wise or not, it could have been tightened up to make things progress more quickly.From the very first book, the biggest facet in Roth's distinct style is her use of real characters. Today's market--no matter the style, genre, age group, or whatever--suffers from an overabundance of perfect people, surface conflicts, and unbelievable situations. For instance: a beautiful, kind, talented girl who doesn't think herself beautiful, kind, or talented falls in love with a mysterious, handsome, secretly-kind boy who tells her otherwise, and they proceed to solve problems come the turn of a page and live happily ever after. Roth destroys this archetype. Her characters are so real, you could expect to walk into any store and see them there. They are flawed, average-looking, talented in unique ways, and always searching for something to make them whole. Within the series, Roth touches on what that Thing is: God.Veronica Roth has never hidden the fact that she's a Christian from any of her fans. What makes her so relatable and believable is that she's a Christian who lives as Christ did: hanging with the outcasts, never preaching directly in someone's face because she thinks they need to hear it or they're going to Hell, always letting people discover for themselves how God is speaking to them through her work. This infusion of reality and faith hits the spirit hard, and this is exactly what Christians need to start doing. We need to set a standard that's far from rose-colored stained glass and be real with not only ourselves and everyone around us, but with God Himself. Roth has begun a precedent I respect highly and strive to follow myself. She has my utmost admiration.Allegiant has zero blasphemy when it comes to cursing; only scattered cusses dot the pages, and characters never use the \"f-word\". The only sensuality to worry about is Tris kissing Four. One character drinks alcohol due to grief over lost friends, but nothing is promoted or glorified. The only thing prevalent in Allegiant is violence; Roth never glorifies or shows explicit pictures of the violence enacted. Guns, knives, fists, and bombs are used as weapons.Though the Divergent series has closed out, I find myself incredibly satisfied by Roth's method. Tris' world will forever live in my heart, and I can only say a thank-you to Veronica Roth for letting the story tell itself instead of dictating what was to happen. The end is already written.

However, it didn't add anything to the story. I still don't think Tris and Tobias had any special spark that made me attached to them as characters. I was constantly confused as to whose chapter I was reading because being inside Tobias' head didn't feel any different. I also still felt that everyone outside of T&T; were interchangeable and easily expendable. I didn't feel that any of them really bonded and every time someone died I felt nothing - none of these characters really seemed to matter.Roth also revealed the explanation for the factions and the cities, but there were so many other layers and revolts that it just feel felt convoluted. Tris and Tobias were ready to jump into any revolt and seemed to just take everything they were told for face value. It was like after everything they went through, they didn't learn anything!My last issue was how Tris acted in the end. I just don't buy that she was so self sacrificing. I felt that she became less believable as the books went on - she didn't feel as mature as her actions made her seem. Overall, I'm glad I read the series, but I wasn't overly impressed by it.

Too many new people were introduced.  Four becomes an insecure pansy.  Of course, maybe he always was and we just saw him how Tris sees him in the previous books.

It finally arrived today, and I started and finished it right away. I'm unsure how to feel. I will try my best to describe it, though. But it will be hard, because I have a lot of feelings and not too many of them are positive. Sorry.I know that I will not be able to write my review without talking about the parts that bothered me the most. So there will be spoilers. But not at first. First, non spoilers. And then I will give a warning and talk mostly about some of the spoilery things :)I don't know how to start. The writing in Allegiant is still very amazing, liked it better than the first two books. The characters are pretty amazing, though I probably only loved Tobias in this book. Tris just could not stop pissing me off. I wish it wasn't that way, but it was and I'm not going to lie about it. I'm giving Allegiant a three star, but right now even that feels like too much when I think of the things that happened.I'm not going to talk too much about the book before I start talking about all the spoilers. Because there isn't much I want to say that doesn't spoil everything. But I am going to say that I did enjoy the book at times, it did some time have things that I enjoyed. I am happy that I read it, because the ending was actually the one thing that I approved of in this book. In a way, which I will explain soon. Some things were interesting to read about. I wasn't bored. But I wasn't very interested in it either. Which sucked.I have seen that people are attacking Veronica as a person after reading Allegiant. I will not do that. Because I adore her and I do think she's pretty amazing. Especially since I got to meet her last summer :) But anyway. I think she did a good job with this book, though I mostly just liked the ending. But I am still very interested in seeing what she writes next, and I'm not going to hate her for not writing this book like I wanted her to do. I do, of course, feel a little bit resentment. But not too much. I hope.Now begins the SPOILERS. Do not read unless you want to know or have finished Allegiant :)I adored Tobias in this book. He just gets better for each book. But seriously. Is anyone ever going to care for him? To love him, and to think of him first? It's starting to bother me a lot that no one does. It isn't fair and to me it felt very overlooked. Tobias deserved more. He deserved more love and more faith. Which he did not get. And that breaks my heart the most. But even so, I adored reading about him and he will always be one of my favorite characters from every book. He is just perfect. So broken.Then there is Tris. My god, I could not stand her in this book. And I'm sorry for saying it, but not really. I did not like her in this book. I did not approve of her choices. She does not talk enough with Tobias. She does not seem to trust him. She does not comfort him at all. And she has done so many mistakes. When he does one, I didn't even think it was that big of a deal, she's breaking up with him. Talk about unfair. I felt like she was being childish. After how much she hurt him, and he survived that. So she should too.There is just so many things in this book that I disliked. We get to know why there are factions, why they live alone. And to be honest, I wasn't impressed with it. It was interesting, but not exciting for me. Things just felt a bit flat for me. The characters weren't very interesting anymore either, and that made me very sad. I did like Christina, though not too much of her either. More of Cara, and I'm even starting to like her more than Tris. She would even be better for Tobias. Sigh. I just did not love this book.One of the worst things about this for me was that Marcus was not punished for all the wrong things he did. I wanted him to die a horrible death. He didn't even get shot or tortured or anything. It wasn't fair and yeah. Not happy about it. I even started liking Peter, and I'm not pleased about his ending either. Didn't truly think he was that much of a coward. I liked Uriah better in this book, but then he had to die. Which truly sucked, because he was one of the better characters. All the good ones die, I suppose.But then. The thing I hated the most happened at about page 300. Tobias does something kind of stupid, like I said above, and Tris is so heartbroken and angry about it and blah blah blah. It was nothing compared to her killing Will. To her giving up her life at several occasions. Yet she acts like Tobias did an unforgiving thing. He did not deserve that kind of treatment at all and it broke my heart. Made me hate Tris a bit. She wasn't being fair. It gets sorted, but not in the way I felt it needed to be.I just couldn't get over the way she treated him. And I'm sorry, but oh. I'm pissed off about it. Which is why I did not mind the ending too much; because Tobias deserved much better than her. Fine, she sacrificed her life for Caleb. But seriously? Why did she do that? Caleb wanted to do it. He didn't have the best boyfriend and the best friends. So why did she go and die, when she said she did not want to leave Tobias? Who does that? I may be able to understand it, but not now. To me it was selfish.But in a way I'm happy she died. It made my heart break for Tobias, because he deserves more than anybody to be happy. It's even making me cry right now, because my heart breaks for him. But I'm happy it was her that died and not Tobias. That would have just been.. unforgiveable. But I'm still not agreeing with it, because to me it was a silly reason. Which you should all get if you have read the book. But anyway. Tobias was the bright point in this book. His point of view was the very best of it all.Oh, and that is the biggest spoiler. Kind of. Because why else would Veronica add Tobias point of view to these books? Oh, because Tris dies and then someone else need to tell the end of the story. I should have gotten that ages ago, when it was announced. Sigh. But anyway. I am glad I read Allegiant, I just know I will not forgive the way Tobias was treated. He deserved so much more and I will stand by that. Anyway. I just had to share my spoilery thoughts. Thank you.

The end.A brief list of the parts of Allegiant that I did enjoy:...Okay, never mind that second list. I honestly can't think of a single thing I liked about this book.Believe me, no one was more disappointed by this than I was. It's been a while since I readDivergentandInsurgent, but I remember feeling so energized by both of them (especially by the ending of Insurgent). And yeah, sure, the world didn't really make a lot of sense from the get-go, but I really didn't care, because the books were SO. MUCH. FUN. Allegiant? It is not fun. It is the exact opposite of fun.**SPOILERS** (because I think they are unavoidable in a negative review of this book)There was just so much about Allegiant that didn't work for me. Let's start with the dual narration between Tris and Tobias. While I actually prefer novels with multiple points-of-view (since it allows for a wider scope), I can't even fully articulate how poorly the strategy was executed in this book. In order for dual narration to be effective, the characters must each have their own inner voice. That was completely absent in Tris and Tobias; they sounded exactly the same. They sounded so similar, in fact, that if I stopped reading at a break in the middle of a chapter, I completely forgot who was narrating when I started reading again (even if it was only five minutes later). Sometimes I'd forget WHILE I was reading! Adding to the confusion is the fact that Tobias and Tris are together for about 90% of the book, so their perspectives really aren't that different. It seems like the only reason Veronica Roth gave us both points of view in Allegiant is because of what happens at the end. And that just isn't reason enough to use that strategy. I would have forgiven her if she did it well, but she definitely didn't.And speaking of Tobias's point of view...it added NOTHING to my understanding of his character. In fact, it actually made me DISLIKE his character quite a bit. Where was the brave Dauntless with only four fears that I knew from the previous books? The man who was scarred, unflinching, but soft somewhere within? What happened to him? Because he certainly doesn't appear in these pages. All Tobias does in Allegiant is whine, make illogical, out-of-character decisions, and whine some more. Dude, okay, we get it. You have daddy and mommy issues (and rightfully so, of course). You're not divergent like you thought you were. The Four that I THOUGHT I knew would have sucked it up and done something about it. But the Four in THIS book wallows endlessly in a pit of self-pity. And when he finally DOES do something, it is so very clearly the wrong thing.The entire book just felt completely pointless. It began with the realization that Edith Prior's message was completely bogus, which made the ending of Insurgent meaningless (and, by the way, the fact that Edith Prior's message was pointless -- and therefore, the reasoning for the message in the first place -- is almost completely glossed over, which irritated me to no end). It ended with Tris's completely pointless death. And between those two events, well, not much really happens. The setting of this book, although outside of Chicago, is very narrow. We don't get much of a view of the world beyond O'Hare, aside from a brief glimpse of the Fringe. And the Fringe, by the way? Really not all that interesting. It COULD HAVE been, if it was utilized more and better. So much about this book COULD HAVE been better. Like, for instance, the plot.The plot was...practically nonexistent. This book is actually BORING for large parts, because nothing really happens. And the plot holes are GIGANTIC. Like the whole explanation for the factions, which makes no sense if you know even the tiniest bit about genetics. And the reasoning behind Tris's death. We need to talk about that.It's not Tris's death itself that bothered me. Not to sound morbid, but I actually think the death of a protagonist or other beloved character can work very well. It can be meaningful, beautiful, heartbreaking, and offer a new perspective. That is, if it's done well -- and if the character's death has some greater meaning.As I mentioned before, Tris's death seemed completely pointless to me. While the death seemed \"in character\" according to what readers know about Tris (that she is selfless and constantly makes dumb decisions in an effort to sacrifice herself for her loved ones), it wasn't at all necessary. The reasons behind her death were completely nonsensical, because the whole \"plan\" that the group came up with to save Chicago was totally ridiculous. You couldn't think of anything better than wiping the memories of the people in the compound, even though the wider world will still have the same ideas about GDs and GPs? Really? I'm giving you the side-eye, Veronica. How about...giving everyone in Chicago the antidote to the memory serum? Or giving David the truth serum and forcing him to give them the password so it wouldn't be necessary to break in? The whole premise was built on such faulty logic and, frankly, felt to me like an insult to the readers' intelligence.Bottom line: Veronica Roth wanted to kill Tris. She came up with this ridiculous idea for how it would happen, ignored all logic and all other possible lines of thinking, and made that happen. And not only did she kill her -- she gave her a passive death. If Tris had gone down fighting (since she spent the whole book up to that point reminding us how much she wanted to live -- foreshadowing 101!), her pointless death could have maaaybe been redeemed for me a bit. Instead, Tris just completely gave up and suddenly became willing to die. Tris was an awesome character -- a bit holier-than-thou (especially in this book) and rash, sure, but still a strong, thoughtful, well-developed character. To have her die like that just didn't do her justice. Not one bit.And I still can't wrap my mind around the stupidity of the conclusion to the factions vs. factionless storyline (most of which occurs outside of this book's pages, again rendering many of the events in Insurgent meaningless). The idea that a whole city -- or, I'm sorry, \"experiment\" -- was saved by a mother's love for her son was just laughable to me -- because NOTHING that Evelyn had done up to that point would indicate that she would choose Tobias over her aspirations. More nonsense. The random secondary character deaths, relayed for the most part with no emotion whatsoever? Nonsense. The reliance on the serums as a major plot device? Nonsense. The blatant disregard for how our DNA actually works? Nonsense.And in the end? More pointlessness, because as we see from the Epilogue, nothing has really changed, aside from the fact that Tris and a bunch of other people are dead. So what did we learn? What was the whole point of the trilogy? That people mend each other? Oh. Okay. I AM GIVING YOU THE SIDE-EYE AGAIN, VERONICA.Bottom line: This book reads like the first draft of a novel that was poorly thought-out. I get the sense that the story just kind of got away from Roth and she didn't really know what to do with it. Like she wrote this fun book about a factioned society, and then later realized she'd need to explain the reasoning behind that societal structure -- and she had no idea how to do that.

But Patrick Rothfuss has said that the best books break your heart. I wasn't sure what to think when I read that (and it makes me nervous to read the third book of his trilogy!), but this book sheds some light on it for me. Veronica Roth made us care so much for her main characters that we mourned when one of them died and another had his heart (figuratively) ripped apart. She touched our hearts. She showed us that sometimes the most valuable things require the most heartbreaking sacrifices, and that these sacrifices are actually worth it.Veronica Roth explains the ending in her 10/28/13 blog post. It's very worth reading. She makes it clear that her loyalty is to the story, and to her themes, not to her readers' happiness, because there is no way for her to please ALL her readers. Does this mean she doesn't care about her readers? Of course not! Read the appreciation page in the book; read her blog. She is so thankful for her readers.She does not, however, owe us the ending we wanted! I prefer a writer who stays true to the story, rather than only trying to please readers. We end up with stories that show us the author's heart, instead of stories that are written to please readers' fantasies and pad the author's wallet.Did I want a happier ending? Oh, absolutely.

I knew something was up, but that was farther than what I expected. And it was exciting! I couldn't wait for Allegiant to come out, I was checking every day to make sure I had the release date right because I was dying to find out how the city handled their issue. And I probably should've left it there, because Allegiant did a 180 and thoroughly destroyed my anticipation. When you finally learn what the true issue is, it's a stretch. Why the author felt the need to try to take her novel to the next level (when it was heading in a perfectly exciting direction) is beyond me. But okay, I understand wanting to be original and trying to make a dystopian novel that's a little \"different.\" I learned to accept the new plot twist and tried to become passionate about it... buy holy moly. I've never been so tired of the word 'damage' in my life. And I'm sure you will, too. Still, that's not enough to warrant a two-star review, because those things are relatively minor. I've read a lot of disappointing reviews giving the book 1 star because of the depressing nature of the ending. After having read the book, I don't really understand what they mean. It's inspiring and there's plenty of closure. Unless accidentally stepping on an ant makes you cry for a week, you'll learn to be fine with the outcome. I promise. The thing that pushed me beyond my limit was the amount of gushy lovey-dovey crud between two of the characters (surely, if you're looking at reviews of Allegiant you know who I mean, but just in case I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't caught up your reading). Is it really necessary to kiss every time you see each other? And not just that, the characters are teenagers. It felt incredibly uncomfortable and disgusting, frankly, to read some of the things going on between them. I know for some people, that's an element that is desired in a book, but it's not that way for me. It felt like Fifty Shades all over again, but it was so uninteresting and unnecessary. The endless bickering gets old quick, and the steamy makeup sessions get old even quicker. At some points in the book I forget that our protagonist is a teenager, but geez, sometimes her companion really throws a fit like one and it's hard to forget they're so young. I know the book is for young adults, but surely even they're annoyed by the senseless lashing out and emotional instability of some of the characters. It doesn't even make sense when they decide to lose their marbles.I could've handled the plot twist. I could've handled the lack of sentence development and even the nature of the ending. I just can't handle this trilogy, which has been so much about society, to suddenly fall apart in the last book. The characters unravel, and only Tris retains some semblance of normalcy by the end of it. Everyone else sort of falls apart and the story focuses predominantly on a love affair that's, to me, pretty insignificant relative to the other plots in the book. There's not really a good resolution to all the mental abuse I put myself through to finish the trilogy, and for that I'm giving Allegiant a two-star review. I hope that for some of you, these things don't bother you.

It rang true for me, and truly, one of the worst feelings was the Tobias chapter immediately after when you knew...and he didn't.]END SPOILERThat being said, any time I open a book (open being figurative, as I read this on my kindle), and there are alternating narrators, I'm inclined to bail. Dueling narration rarely works. In fact, I find it often kills a book for me. It works so much better (if it works at all) in a book with two authors because they're able to keep the individual character voices really distinct. It's so much harder for a single author to pull off the same thing, and pulling it off is a mark of real skill.Veronica Roth did not pull it off.Tris and Tobias sounded nearly the same to me throughout the book, as they have not in the previous two novels. Their perspectives were different, and I while I will own that it was interesting to hear some of Four's perspective on the same events, I would just as soon had Tris up until the thing that made the internet explode and someone else as a coda.It's worth noting, also, that the fact that this is the only book of the trilogy to utilize the two narrator format threw up red flags for me from the very beginning. An author doesn't pull a switch like that without a reason, and the only logical reason I could come up with was the thing that made the internet explode and thus, was not surprised when it happened.It is also worth noting that 75% of this book reads like an infodump.

The series skips around such facts as how the basic needs of a population are met, while the younger generation goes on to battle prejudice and corruption.", "reviewerName": "C. F.

Sure, Veronica Roth gave a thorough explanation about what really happened in the past for the factions to rise.  But it felt very draggy. And a plot device that had me eye rolling was suddenly thrown into the way in an attempt to keep this book interesting and longer.  Where I expected to be mindblown with terrific revelations, I felt I was cheated because Allegiant didn't rise from those tropes of trilogies that lost their firepower during the conclusion phase. Le sigh. I was literally asking myself, \"Where was the series that I love? Where was the book that made me lose sleep for over a year? Am I reading the correct book? Maybe I bought a fanfiction or something...?\"I was just glad that with Allegiant, Veronica  gave a thorough explanation about the factions, Chicago and most importantly, Divergence. It is also worth mentioning that the romance here developed in a way that is realistic and swoon worthy but ain't cheesy. And yes,there's also a slight development with Tris and Four's characterization.  However, some of the characters (especially the secondary ones) were neglected and only existed as props.Perhaps, I will also have to credit Veronica's world building. It surely is very believable and downright outstanding considering that she incorporated other cities into the whole story.And I am not so sure whether the ending will work for you or not. As for me, I didn't love or hate it. All I'm sure is that it was necessary to keep things more conceivable given the circumstances of the situation. I would really like to say about it more but I will risk ruining your reading experience.All in all, I enjoyed this one but it didn't hold the same magic as Divergent (book 1).

The further explorations of this dystopian world was very interesting, but I really didn't feel it was believable - especially the attitude that analyzing human nature by genes is a valid way to assess the potential of a human being.  It's not nature over nurture since both are important in contributing to a person's personality.  I am disappointed by how unscientific these scientists in the book are.  Especially since they are supposed to be so advanced and have made such breakthroughs.Tris and Tobias were also disappointing to me in this, because they again act in ways that are really frustrating.  I continued to lose sympathy for them in their predicaments, especially with Tobias in a certain plot development.  It didn't help that I felt like there were a few too many passages where Tris and Tobias described how the other looks or smells.  It's kind of annoying and there are lots of bigger issues here. With the writing, I also had an issue with how many similes were used - it felt unnecessary and ridiculous and almost like padding out a story that really could have gotten to the point sooner.No spoilers for the ending, but it is a very difficult one to come to terms with, and yet because I felt so disconnected to the characters, there wasn't really a huge impact for me.  It's a surprise, but I didn't feel emotional over it.

It is everything that leads up to ending which made it impossible for me to actually finish the book. I had to just skim ahead and read the ending because the middle of the book was so tedious. The duel POV, in first person PRESENT tense, wasn't done well and I think that is what killed the book for me. I will admit that I am pretty sensitive to POV shifts along with tense shifts. I find them jarring, particularly in first person. Every chapter I felt like I had to reset and start all over again. It made reading this book a challenge. The voices for both characters were weak, and even the Tris chapters do not at all read like the Tris of the first two books. It just did hold together for me, and it really pains me to say that.Perhaps in a few months I will re-read the book, being aware of its faults (I mean, all books have faults) and maybe I won't have the same reactions.

I was blown away by those two books. But at the end of Insurgent I was very nervous about where things were going to go next. It felt like the beginning of something new. And in a sense, it was. In reading Allegiant, it felt like something, or rather several things, were just off. Here are some of my issues with Allegiant:1. Reading Allegiant felt like I was reading the beginning of a completely different series. I don't mind that it was different, except that the differences lost the flow and integrity the first two books had for me. Even though I could see the connection Roth was trying to make, the storyline still felt disconnected from its predecessors.2. The pacing dragged for me, which was so unlike the way the first two books were. My nerves were also very high considering people trying to spoil everything for me, so I had to avoid a lot of internet stuff. If it weren't for that spurning, it would have been very easy to set this book aside, because it was slow. I was actually very tempted to set it aside and read something else, but my investment in this trilogy and those spoilery people out there helped me maintain my focus. The first time I read Divergent, I read it in a day, then immediately re-read it. Allegiant took me longer and I wasn't compelled to flip through the pages as quickly.3. Too much info-dumping. There were several info-dump sites, and it just really took away from the pacing and story. This is another reason why this book felt like the start to a series rather than the end of one. Part of me expected Roth to add a fourth book because there was so much added info.4. There were plot holes in the end, and I think if this book had been more thought through, it could have been extended to a fourth book, the storyline reworked to flow better and convey Roth's message and intention better. Also, I found it odd that this scientific society that develops these highly complicated serums, that they couldn't create serums or other advancements for other medical issues.5. The character development was off, or lacking. If anything, I think most of the characters regressed. The squabbles between the main characters were quite annoying and even redundant. While the other characters just seemed to fade into the wallpaper, offering bits and pieces here and there, but not nearly the forces they were previously. The other characters felt wasted and didn't offer very much, except for the intermittent heartbreak or a splash or jealousy for effect. And honestly, I just didn't love Tris and Tobias as much in this one the way I did before, though I probably liked Tobias slightly more because he wasn't as full of himself as Tris was. Her character development made her out to be so great and so wonderful and always right and it just didn't work for me. At least Tobias could be humble, and I did appreciate that.6. The dual POVs slowed everything down. This factored into my previously stated pacing issues. There also wasn't a clearly distinguishable voice between Tris and Tobias. Several times I had to go back to the heading of a chapter and find out who was narrating. More often than not I had mixed up the character in my head and thought the opposite person had been speaking.7. The action plateaued for most of the book. There were a few good, intense scenes, but they were resolved quickly. Even the climactic scenes in the end weren't really all that climactic. There was a lot of thinking and self-reflection and philosophizing.8. The message just didn't work for me and wasn't as poignant as I think Roth intended. And while I can appreciate the attempt, the message of this last book, even the message(s) didn't feel complete.9. I also can handle an ending that's not all rainbows and kittens, but the ending still has to make sense to me. This one, while I can see Roth's reasoning, still didn't feel necessary. Or make complete sense. I have multiple issues with it. But the ending was not the deal-breaker for me. I don't mind a twist to an ending, and welcome authors who want to go against convention. And this one could have worked if it had not been for things that had already happened in the book.10. Plus, this book on a whole, was just way too depressing. Kinda made me want to pull an Al and jump in the chasm. I don't know if it was for shock value or because Roth is just a negative &#34;life sucks&#34; kind of person or because this is her perspective on the future and that everything needs to be tragic, but on the whole Allegiant was just depressing. Not that we didn't have our tragedies in Divergent or Insurgent. These are not happy-go-lucky books. But Allegiant just took it a step further, a step too far.Do I have anything positive to say? Well, there were a few lovely moments between Tris and Tobias, some meaningful thought and intentions to the story. I think for some people, this book will work really well for them. I've seen high ratings on this book from others, and I'm glad that this book lived up to their expectations and they gleaned enjoyment from its reading.Personally, I just feel let down, and once again, it's not because of the way it ended, but the overall book itself. I know many people are disappointed with the ending, and if I'm being honest, I am too. But overall, even if it had ended differently, this book still would not have been at the same caliber level as the first two books. I tried very hard throughout the entire book to give Roth the benefit of the doubt and not put preconceived notions and expectations into this book. I know the first two books were a lot to live up to, but I don't think I've been let down by a book like this in a while. So am I glad I read it? Still not sure. Would I recommend it to others? Good question. I think that would depend on if you are a series-finisher and how dedicated you were to the first two books. Will I re-read it?

Maybe it's that I'm a fellow Illinoisian and wanted to believe that a hometown author could deliver a great finish to a series that takes place in Chicago.  Or possibly it's that I couldn't believe such a mess of a trilogy could have received a movie deal and surely was going to get better by the end of this book.  Unfortunately I was wrong, and if you've read the first two books, you're in for a big surprise when you find out how much worse it gets in the final installment.The most striking feature of the first two books is the apparent lack of a central conflict in both the books and the series as a whole.  After just about any novel, you can always sum up the central conflict in a few sentences, whether you're talking about a classic work of fiction or a mass-market mystery.  What exactly is the &#34;big problem&#34; that Tris and Four are fighting against in Divergent and Insurgent?  Think of any other series of books and the answer is immediately obvious.  Lord of the Rings=Sauron and the ring.  Hunger Games=President Snow.  Harry Potter=Voldemort. So, what's the problem or conflict in the Divergent series?  It eventually becomes clear late in Allegiant, but when you introduce the &#34;big problem&#34; of a trilogy only halfway into the last book, it's hard to establish enough buildup to make for a satisfying ending.  Instead, the story moves lethargically from one micro-conflict to another, with each minor problem being solved almost immediately, much in the same way that a second-grade author might solve a conflict in a submission for a Young Authors contest.  Between these micro-conflicts, you'll be subjected to ruthless stalling and expectations to care for secondary characters that have no bearing to the central story.The end is a pathetic distraction, designed to make you forget about the lack of substance in this book, as well as the other two.  Instead of devising a central conflict that escalated up until the final pages, Ms. Roth plops around from one minor problem to the next, with the &#34;final battle&#34; feeling no more significant than any of the other endeavors that the cast of characters battle.", "reviewerName": "Chris", "summary": "Where's the conflict?", "helpful": [3, 3], "overall": 1.0, "unixReviewTime": 1392681600, "reviewerID": "AG9PN0U0RUC72"}

TURN BACK NOW YE WHO WISH TO REMAIN UNSPOILED.I wasn't sure I was going to write a review of Allegiant, especially because a lot of other people have already touched on my primary problems (POV shifts being weak, writing so spare and minimalistic as to be completely incomprehensible at times) but I did want to talk a little more about Tris's death.Tris is a Christ figure. Throughout each book, even the bulk of Allegiant, we're shown over and over that she is her world's messiah. She is immune to the serums, she's shockingly \"genetically pure\" (which has it's own slew of problems that I don't think a white, upper-middle class woman should ever have written about, least of all someone as young as Roth), she's powerfully Divergent, etc etc etc. These things aren't necessarily a problem. The messianic figure has been a trope for hundreds of years, even pre-Christ. The Christ story is the one Western culture associates most strongly with the messianic figure, however, and because of that we expect a messiah story to go a certain way. Namely, we expect the messiah to come back from the dead.There are plenty of stories that deconstruct tropes - and the deconstruction of tropes is incredibly popular in media right now. Allegiant isn't a deconstruction. None of the Divergent books were a deconstruction of the messiah. None of them implied, in any way, that the human race doesn't need someone to lead it to salvation - which is exactly what Tris is doing throughout two and a half books. When she dies in Allegiant, the messiah trope isn't deconstructed. It's destroyed. And because tropes are a way to understand and parse media and stories, the reader is left utterly baffled and confused. This, in my opinion, is the primary failure of Allegiant. The destruction of a trope that Roth spent no time deconstructing is the problem, and it's the reason people are railing so hard against this story.", "reviewerName": "Christina L.

You have all heard about the ending and everyone's reactions to it at this point, right? Okay, I hated the ending. It was terribly sad and in all honesty, I don't quite understand why it was done. Maybe because it was unique compared to other dystopias? I'm not sure but I didn't like it! I cried for hours and am now in a terrible book hangover.I didn't give this book 2.5-3 stars because of the ending, though. I just want to clear that up right now. Yes, I don't agree with it but it still had me bawling and I appreciate Roth's ability to affect me that way. The real reason I gave it 2.5-3 stars is just the overall concept and execution of the book. For one, and I'm sad to admit this, but aside from the ending, ALLEGIANT was kind of boring. What should have been an extremely climactic book with our lot of characters venturing over the fence, wasn't. They just sort of went. I didn't feel the intensity and suspense like I felt in the other two books.Another thing I didn't particularly like was the explanation for why Chicago was the way it was. That, too, wasn't a huge, world crushing revelation like I thought it was going to be. It was also really confusing to follow along. I was sitting there trying to figure out what all it meant and why it even really mattered in the first place.My biggest thing with this book is the switching point of views. I know everyone loved Tobias and wanted to hear his side of things, I get that. However, his and Tris' voice and personality were just too alike in this book. If I didn't pay close attention when I started a new chapter, I automatically thought I was reading Tris' POV like the other two books. Only upon seeing Tris mentioned did I realize, whoops, this is Tobias' chapter. They just didn't have big enough differences in thought processes to make the switching POV work in my opinion. If there was more of a contrast then I think I would have enjoyed the refreshing change of scenery so to speak.I love the Divergent series and unfortunately, ALLEGIANT fell flat for me executionally.

{"reviewTime": "12 17, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Do you sometimes get that feeling when you read a book? That feeling that the author doesn&#8217;t want to be writing the book that you&#8217;re reading? That feeling that the book could have ended chapters ago, yet the author keeps filling it with fluff? That feeling that the author betrayed the story for money and that their love for their story pretty much died?Well, I kind of got that feeling while I was reading this.I know that it seems that I&#8217;m being kind of brash and rude with my opening, but hear me out&#8230; I&#8217;m a fan of Veronica Roth and will support her next publication so I am not writing this review out of spite or because I&#8217;m trying to be a hater.With that said, I&#8217;m trying to write without spoilers so, hopefully, my review makes sense&#8230;First off, ALLEGIANT differs from the first two books because she utilizes dual narrative. Normally, I&#8217;m not opposed to it at all because, when executed properly, dual narrative can bring fresh insights into the story and the characters. So, when I first read that Veronica Roth was going to write in a dual narrative, I was ecstatic because I thought that she had the necessary talent into providing an unique voice to Four (I never read the novellas/short stories, so this is/was the first time I would be reading from his perspective). You can only imagine my surprise and disappointment when Four&#8217;s voice was Tris&#8217; voice.It wasn&#8217;t &#8220;similiar&#8221; to hers&#8230; it was her. Basically, Four&#8217;s chapters was Tris speaking while looking through Tobias&#8217; eyes. And, that disappointed me because it was kind of like she knew that fans were going to buy the books irregardless of how she wrote the voices, so she kind of half-assed it&#8230;Moving on!The plot! I didn&#8217;t hate the plot as much as some of the other people who read the book. I mean, it certainly wasn&#8217;t a twist I was expecting but, just because I wasn&#8217;t expecting it, doesn&#8217;t mean that it wasn&#8217;t *that* bad. So, I&#8217;m not really going to rant about the history behind how the factions came to be because there are other people who rant about it enough for everyone~BUT, I do care about HOW THEY GOT OUTSIDE THE FENCE!!!! THAT WAS SUCH A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! IT WAS THE MOTHER OF ALL DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME!(This is kind of a mini-spoiler&#8230; NOT THAT IT MATTERS SINCE THIS TAKES UP LIKE THREE PARAGRAPHS IN THE ACTUAL BOOK!.. Not literally, but you get my gist&#8230;)Throughout the entire series, it was always &#8220;nobody wants to go outside the fence&#8221; and &#8220;the world outside is bad&#8221; and etc. so when they finally decided to go outside, I thought that that journey alone was going to take up a good portion of the story. After all, I was sure that there were many security protocols to prevent people from leaving and, once outside, I was sure that they were going to face many perils and etc before they finally reach the answer.Nope.That was a blink-and-you&#8217;ll-miss-it scene. Like, no joke, it was like let&#8217;s hop on a train and &#8220;wow, we&#8217;re outside&#8221; and *poof* some people comes out and says &#8220;come into our building where we&#8217;ll feed you and take care of you and explain what we&#8217;ve been doing outside&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;Yeah&#8230;Okay, it wasn&#8217;t literally like that and someone did die, but still!! Where was the danger? The excitement? The feels that should have been over the death!? (Notice how I&#8217;m trying not to leave too big of a spoiler~)Ugh&#8230; okay, that is pretty much all I can write for this review. I can write more, but I would rather not want to.

On the third day, I pre-ordered the third book, anxiously waiting for my questions to be answered, like everyone else who had been with Tris and Four throughout the whole ordeal.I got the book (in hard copy, not on Kindle only because the other two I had were in hard copy too and I have a thing about owning a series all in one format or another).  I sat down and read it in one day (big surprise).****SPOILER ALERT*****First, it was as I had predicted to my husband.  There was a government lab/experiment similar to the Village (a horrible movie by M. Night Shamalamadingdong - don't waste your life watching it).  There was more to the factions than we originally knew.  There were horrible injustices being done to innocent people in the name of pure genetic makeups.I suppose that I should not be surprised that it came down to genetic engineering, something that people are always wondering about.  To that end, seeing how it still gives people a sense of superiority over each other, another way to divide society, it was disappointing to know that, at least in this future, we will not reach a place where we finally acknowledge each other as equals (you know, like they do in Star Trek).Now, the ending couldn't have happened any other way.  If there had been a HAE then it would have been too mushy and too predictable.  Did I want there to be a HAE for both of them?  Yes.  They both had a very sad existence, hard lives, hard initiations, had people close to them die.  Didn't they deserve to be a little happy?  Didn't they deserve just a few days to really enjoy being with each other?  They never got that opportunity.  But in the end, it was the only way.  She was the only way.  The upsetting thing though, through it all, is that I got the sense that the government did not stop doing what they were doing.  They may have disbanded the Chicago experiment, but I don't think that stopped everything altogether.  In a way, it felt like she died in vain and that really upset me I think.  Knowing that she could have been happy.  She could have helped people more.Does her death make me hate the book?  No.  Does it make me question if I would have read the whole series and allowed my nerdy self to get attached to the characters as much as i did.  Yes.  I hate crying over a book!

The trilogy is the supposed competition to the Hunger Games series. If only this was remotely true. The first two books of the Divergent series are half decent, butut, the finale, Allegiant, is awful. It is so poorly written and so unimaginably far-fetched that it ruined the entire series.First of all, the entire book felt forced. Insurgent ended with a great cliff hanger, and I couldn't wait to see what happened. Then, after reading the first few chapters of monotone information, I came to the conclusion that this book was forced. It seemed that there was an exponential amount of poor writing. The forced element of this book is clearly evident when Veronica Roth &#34;throws&#34; in this quote: &#8220;You're not very nice,&#34; I say, grinning. &#34;You're one to talk.&#34; &#34;Hey, I could be nice if I tried.&#34; &#34;Hmm.&#34; He taps his chin. &#34;Say something nice, then.&#34; &#34;You're very good-looking.&#34; He smiles, his teeth a flash in this dark. &#34;I like this 'nice' thing.&#8221; (Roth 121).

The main reason for this is due to the change in POV. The first two books are all told by Tris. In Allegiant, Roth chose to alternate between Tris and Four/Tobias. It could have worked, however, it was poorly executed. From the beginning, I had to pay close attention to the name at the start of each chapter (which is where the point of view shifts). Again and again, I found myself confused. The narrative voice was always the same and it was virtually impossible to tell if it was a Tris chapter or a Four chapter. I would find myself searching for little clues or jumping back the chapter start to check. As you might imagine, this was very annoying.Along with the new part-time narration by Four, we get a peak inside his head. Well, intentional or not, Four comes off whiny, weak, and a bit of a mess. How we see him through his own voice is quite a bit different from how we&#8217;ve seen him in the past through Tris.There are also some revelations in this one that made me less than happy.

I would like to say that I was not as enamored with the first two books as my sister is but I like them enough to be interested.  I seem to like more flawed characters.  They seem more relatable especially when sufficient backed by back story.  I am not a literary specialist either.First I will agree with those that say the switching back an forth became a little confusing.  There were several times that I had to go back and check whose voice I was listening.  There was no pattern to go by which might have made it easier.Second I am not someone who will completely against a non happy ending.  I watch much Joss Whedon and even when the idea of Buffy ending with Season 5 it still made sense.  He built up to that sacrifice over several seasons even.  He also killed of many well loved characters on many of his different projects.  I still watch his stuff knowing that can happen.  (poor Fred)  I was horrified and sad when Dumbledore died, but I still wanted to finish the Harry Potter series even knowing that she could even kill off Harry Potter.  Everything was so well done and so well written and just made sense to me.{Contains Spoilers}That being said.  This book felt a little rushed.  As I was reading it, I was thinking that all the new information was setting up more books.  I have to agree the science behind the genetics was not explained.  Tris as \"special\" was not explained.  Then I got to the \"end\" of the Tris part and thought.  I don't understand why?  It was not a character development.  Why spend the time building up a \"relationship\" between two characters if this was the end all along?  The only reason to build a relationship up seems to be just to sell the book the teenage romantic set.  To build that kind of following then take the book into such a dark place as to just kill off Tris with no further explanation. Nothing felt complete to me.  It actually felt as if the author was just making sure that there was no pressure to write anymore books.  As many have expressed, I have no desire to go see Divergent now and no want to read this author anytime soon.  I am glad for VR to be able to tell her story as she wanted, but I don't think I am going to drink the good review Kool-Aide that is telling me that this book does represent hope.  It does not IMO.  Even Christ rose from the grave.  VR opened Pandora's box and forgot to make sure that Hope was placed in the bottom.Maybe it is my lack of literary knowledge prohibits me from being able to understand the B+ and 4 star rating from critics.  I don't feel the characters were well developed.  I don't feel like I understand what is truly the greater sin. I understand what the message was but that was because it was spelled out better then the whole GP and GN issue.  Not matter what out genetic make up is we are essentially human and all capable of evil and good.At this point I don't even think I am ready to hear VR's explanation that she seems will come.  I will read it eventually, but it doesn't make up for poor and quick storytelling.I do wonder how the Studio that bought the rights to the story are feeling right now.

It grabs you and doesn't let go, even after its over.I had seen that Allegiant didn't receive the high ratings the other two books did, but did not want to read a single review or know why. I am glad that I stayed away from the negativity and spoilers so that I could see Allegiant for what it was. I had a feeling that the ending was going to be sad and so I formulated a few theories in order to prepare myself. And yes, I cried and cried. I sat on my bed reading in the dark with tears streaming down my face and my heart breaking. And that emotion evoked from a story is one of the reasons that this book got a 5 star rating from me. I wish I could rate it higher.I love the characters in this series because they are so much more than that. They are all so front and center, no matter how small their role is. You grow so attached to them that even the smallest amount of pain they feel causes you pain as well.I have to say that Tris is easily one of my favorite female leads. She is real and one of those characters that you find yourself wanting to be more like. Yes, I realize that she is a sixteen year old girl, but she is so much more than that, too. She is brave and selfless. She is strong and doesn't fall victim to the normal girly crap. There were times that I kind of wanted her to be more &#34;normal&#34;, but I am so glad that she wasn't. She is kick-ass and I love that. Her character is refreshing.Tobias is beautiful. He is strong, yet so broken, and his struggle to become more makes him great. Yes, he is stubborn and makes some stupid choices, but those choices are what make him better. And his love for Tris and his friends is powerful. There is nothing he wouldn't do to protect them. His journey throughout this series is amazing.I won't talk about the story details because I don't like spoilers. What I will say is that I think it took a lot of guts for Veronica Roth to end this series this way, and I think it was a fitting ending. Was it the ideal ending that everyone wanted? Obviously not. But it was great. This book is suspenseful and emotional. Once you start reading, you won't stop until its over. And then you will want it to keep going.Veronica Roth created a world and characters that are hard to walk away from. The thing that makes me most sad is that it is over and I have no more to read.

I feel this book, this ending so deep within me that I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be able to properly separate myself from it to type clearly, so please bear with me.Now, let me start off my own thoughts by telling you that I know it has raised some rather harsh reviews from readers, and I understand why in only one aspect&#8211;that the ending is not what anyone wanted. But I think that was part of the point that was being made. Life isn&#8217;t fair, and people have to die. When I read a book and ultimately suffer the loss of a character&#8211;a person within the story that I am close to, a person I identify with and spend the entire series growing alongside, a friend&#8211;that has a tendency to invoke a complete and utter devastation to my psyche. So yeah, the series didn&#8217;t end how I wanted it to because I would NEVER actually want to lose that friend. But you know what? It made sense. It really did, which is why I can accept it&#8211;as slowly and painstakingly as my heart feels like it&#8217;s been ripped out and boiled in acid, I can accept it.There were times when reading through the story I was getting so frustrated&#8211;at Tris, at Tobias, at EVERYONE&#8211;I was sighing and groaning and nearly pulling my hair out, pausing to cover my eyes like I couldn&#8217;t believe what was happening. But there were those times when I was so happy for Tris & Tobias, so excited for the next piece of the plot to come and then BAM! The next moment I&#8217;d be reeling from death and action. So much feels in this one book that left me analyzing myself, and how I would feel and how I would react, and who/what is right or wrong? What would I do? A true roller coaster of emotion that I will return to read again and again. And that&#8217;s part of what I like to judge a book on&#8211;the ability the story has to make that connection with me on more than just a reader-story level. When there&#8217;s no disconnect, when there&#8217;s a bond that ties me personally to the lives within the book and I genuinely feel attached to the characters, I know the story is worth it&#8211;to me, at least.I really do realize that there are a lot of people who are upset with this book out there, and I&#8217;m not just here to pledge my blind allegiance (see what I did there?) to this series because of the books that came before&#8211;I truly love this story and was so wrapped up in it that I felt akin to what the characters themselves were feeling. I know that in my personal experience, every book I have ever read that has tied me irrevocably to its story forever has been one that has lost integral characters in the ultimate struggle, in the end. It keeps me feeling human, because it&#8217;s rare that everything you want will work out perfectly, tied up like a pretty package with a little red bow on it.Sorry if this review seemed a bit preachy&#8211;remember when I warned you at the start about my working to process what happened?

I was so angry when I finished reading Allegiant that if I had written my review then I would of broken my #1 cardinal rule of reviewing: no author bashing (yes I was that angry).  Now I don't feel quite like that. I'm still angry about what happened in Allegiant - very angry - in fact when talking to my friends about it I almost always refer to it as &#34;Effing Allegiant&#34;.  However, I am no longer angry at Veronica Roth!  It was her story to tell how she saw fit and how the characters told her to.  I'm not here to judge her, but I kinda hate the whole last book of this series and wish I skipped it.  On a plus side, it did make me feel, I felt a LOT and the emotions I felt (both positive and negative) were STRONG.  I was really close to not bothering with the movies now that I know how it all ends... then I saw the trailers and remember why I loved Divergent and Insurgent - Theo James doesn't hurt either!  I never thought I'd say this but I really hope Hollywood changes the ending.So why didn't I like it?  Well it was kind of like The Truman Show meets Logan 's Run.  It was just plain odd.

{"reviewTime": "11 22, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I think many people would agree that Allegiant has been the most anticipated YA release of 2013. The third and final installment of Veronica Roth's Divergent series picks up right where Insurgent left off: Tris Prior learns that her world of factions is just a small ecosystem in a much larger world, created to help defend the outside world with Divergent. With Evelyn Johnson abolishing factions and running the city like a tyrant, Tris and Tobias head outside the city limits to discover the world beyond.I  have incredibly mixed feelings about Allegiant, but at the end of the day I enjoyed it, especially because of the ending which I will not spoil for you. Unfortunately the book started with a bad taste in my mouth because of all these Four novellas Roth is releasing to lead up to the Divergent movie release. I enjoyed Free Four to get me through the wait between books, but a whole series of Four novellas just to pump the movie? I think the series does better without them and all I see them as is a ploy for more money. It's money, I get it. But overall I think it chips away at the credibility of the Divergent trilogy and franchise. I find it's insulting to loyal readers, especially considering it would have made more sense to appease us in between the actual books. I think I would have been more receptive if it was one book from Four's perspective instead of four cheap teasers. I read The Transfer right before I read Allegiant, and, even though it was a sound novella, it left a bad taste in my mouth because of all the reasons above. I didn't trust Roth as an author anymore because now I feel she's just in it for the money. Not the best way to begin a new book!Overall this novel seemed very aimless to me. I never felt like there was a distinct arc that I could follow and consequently found it difficult to gauge how far along with the book I had read. I suppose I could give Roth the benefit of the doubt that she wants the reader to feel as aimless as Tris, but given my previous rant, I was too disheartened to believe this. If not for the great ending, I would have been extremely disappointed in the book overall.Another difficult part of this book to reconcile is the extreme change in scenery, which reminded me of Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay. The change of primary setting from the first two books took me out of my comfort zone as a reader. I never realize how a constant setting plays such an integral role in a series until it's taken away and the new setting takes some adjustment. This isn't a criticism of the writing because I understand it was necessary, but it might have played into why I felt this book was so aimless.At the end of the day, though, Roth is still an incredible writer and she can't go wrong with the cast of characters she has created. The themes of identity and being capable of creating ones own future are strong in this book and there are a lot of important lessons Tris and Tobias learn together. I could go on about various parts of this book, but I don't want to imply any spoilers. Despite my complaints, I still enjoyed every ounce of Tris' adventure, especially her evolving ideas of right and wrong. She remains one of my favorite female protagonists and a reason why I'll always recommend this series to other readers.Bottom Line: My feelings are so mixed, but overall I recommend this book and series, especially if you've already invested the time in the first two books in the series. 3.5/5 stars, but I'm rounding up for the ending.", "reviewerName": "Danielle", "summary": "Great Ending, but Aimless Final Book", "helpful": [1, 5], "overall": 4.0, "unixReviewTime": 1385078400, "reviewerID": "A1V5X0ZEQJ8I56"}
{"reviewTime": "10 27, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "The 3rd, and sadly final, installment in the Divergent Trilogy was an emotional rollercoaster for me. I didn't want to begin reading right away because I knew it would be the end, so I savored books 1 and 2 again, then began nice and slow - even taking breaks between chapters, and re-reading sections as I went.Allegiant is told from 2 points of view: Tris and Tobias. I love Four, but I am so used to reading Tris that I wanted to stick with her. With Tobias, we get less insight into his feelings and emotions. He tells us but it doesn't seem to come from 'him' - leaving me with the feeling that Roth never fully got into his mind. If I could give half stars, I would have knocked off 1/2 star because of this.Once I adapted to that switching narrative, I was better able to keep track of who was talking. It was interesting to see how he was quite in awe of Tris though, and how complex he really is.Life is messy, hard, and emotional. A utopia gone wrong, war, is naturally messier, with much more trauma. Roth didn't spare us. She went there, and about half way through the book, I realized she was going to. I didn't know how, but I knew I wasn't going to be happy with whatever ending was coming. I am fine with her decision, it's possibly more realistic than so many of the other routes she could have gone. The ending isn't the point, either; it's the journey of a story that matters most. If it were all about the ending, let's just skip the book and go there, right?But still... I am torn between applauding the courage of the writing and hating it. It's rare that I love the end of a trilogy though. If I have invested that much time, I want more, and sometimes authors take drastic measures to bring it to a close, so I am not often going to be happy with it.Despite some of the downfalls, Veronica Roth still wrote a success that has given me a book hangover, it got under my skin so I wanted more, I wanted to read it when I was working, or when I should have been sleeping. I loved Tris and Four (and Tobias, because really, he was 2 different people, a mask and himself) - I loved them like they were real, and that's some good writing that can do that - they'll stick with me for a while longer.Roth was brave and honest.

The big incident that readers got so upset about actually made me love the book, the series, and the author all the more. I thought it was a perfect and fitting end for each of the characters and the plot. The only thing I didn't quite understand or agree with, was how Peter came to his decision, but it wasn't a big enough deal to bother me one way or the other.Despite all this, Roth&#8217;s writing style is still not my favorite and it was not a perfect book by any means (but what books are?). I&#8217;d say my biggest issue was that there wasn't a strong difference in the voices of the two narrators. Part of that is because both Tris and Tobias are fairly dry, humorless characters. Their actions are dynamic, but neither are very colorful people. They&#8217;re matter-of-fact and that tends to make them sound similar, enough so that I couldn't always tell whose head I was in, and that&#8217;s not good. Personally, I don&#8217;t care for books that swap narrators, and I didn't really see the point (since the first two books were in Tris&#8217;s POV only), but it made more sense as the book went along and didn't bother me by the end.So, with all that, I gave it 4/5 stars. I almost gave it 5/5 to spite all the reviewers that gave it a 1 to be nasty, but I&#8217;m not that kind of girl.

{"reviewTime": "10 26, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": ". Short & simply WHY. This in no way played out in a cliche predictable manner as a 32 year old fan and reader of the previous two books (also a pretty seasoned bookstore that is a huge, huge fan of the same people Ms. Roth in blogging and such writings made her fan base aware of her OWN fandom--like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games. This is set in dystopia America, and yes indeed the United  States.) has I am not so sure in my mind why the word \"ALLEGIANT\" was thought to be a good title as I read the book. I looked up the precise definition because I had noticed the author like me has an affection for interesting wordy English words that make you seem really smart or snobbish (depending on your perspective)...and indeed admitted to an obsession with changing names in the teaser book to this when comparing a human transformation to a metaphorical name change. She is setting the stage for some deeply psychological METAPHORICAL situations.For me, I admit this book came at either the perfect point or the worst. I deeply hate this book but not because it was bad. I hate this book because I had been looking forward to it for months. When I read it I am haunted by this thick sadness that crawls back in to my waking moments. I try not be AS masochistic as was when I was younger. I literally begin to become a bit unhinged and haunted by the combo that IS Tris & Four.  As their personal struggles deepen I'm examining my own. Like Four I have the emotional damage from childhood. Like Tris, I'm processing grief of my mother who died just last month. My father in 2011. I'm still relatively young to have no PARENTS. In fact I'm the only person I know who ran out of grandparents @ age 17. I have seen a lot of death in my life. But nothing hurt me as acutely as losing my mom and dad between 2011-2013.  I am 32 & the only person on earth that cares whether I breathe or Don't is lying beside me asleep. I can't sleep. I'm \"bipolar\" you see. As good as genetically damaged!! The themes in ALLEGIANT are so close to my real life I'm visibly shaken because this book has reminded me of every single of biggest worries.  And so artfully that I wasn't fully aware the book was causing me to manner a lol more depressed today than usually.  Normally I can try to mentally & emotionally fight all my demons.  IT'S EXCEPTIONALLY HARD TO DO WHEN YOUR DISTRACTION, IS TRIGGERING EMOTIONALLY CHARGED EVENTS, QUESTIONS INTO YOUR ALL READY GRIEF STRICKEN MIND.  I have been keeping alive and my THE demons at bay. I don't know if someone close Ms. Roth died. However, she has experienced it. Only someone STRICKEN with grief could put this under current in her book. JK ROWLING said her books, the Potter series were about her getting over her mother's death. I may have to read them again after this horrific trail of trauma.  I SAY THAT BUT I MEAN IT A GOOD WAY, THE. EFFECT ON ME RIGHT NOW IS TERRIBLE. EVEN THE LAST WORDS OF THE BOOK HAVE NO IMPACT ON ME. I'm emotionally spent and I would take memory serum!  THEN there is a SOMEONE running his fingers through my hair. And the guilt that wells up inside of me at even the thought of memory serum. That is when I TRULY understand the title. The last scene. The last words. I know without a shadow of doubt had I done just one thing differently and NOT fallen in love with this wonderful man asleep beside me who just today told me I was the kindest hearted person he ever met & I ask incredulous of the truth that thought how it could be true, he is reassuring ME I am a worthy human being because this book not only has me going down memory lane....But I am questioning society. I'm looking @ the things that happened to my parents in sickness & death as this\"system\" capitalized and cannibalized my family down to me. I feel guilty for things doctors did or did not do.This was a really unpredictable book for me. I truly didn't expect this series to be so damned depressing. I read these books for hope. I have enough realism in my life.Like most readers I'm confused. I stayed away from all media after its release and just found out my reaction isn't an anomaly!!!  People are mad for buying this book. I thought this book was getting to my grief. Maybe I was getting to bored and my mind was wondering.  I did scroll right down through my kindle.

Please don't continue if you haven't finished the series.Before I read Allegiant, I saw the negative outpouring here and figured readers were upset because the romance did not resolve how they wanted. I was completely wrong.People are upset because they feel cheated--and very rightfully so. When you write a book series in the first person voice, you are entering into a default agreement with your readers. Veronica Roth broke this agreement, plain and simple. The first-person narrator always survives the story. To have any other result is ridiculously illogical and a cheap trick to boot. This is very basic, beginning creative writing stuff. If a student writer tried to pull something like this in a creative writing course, they'd be laughed out of the room.To make matters worse, Roth maintains that she planned the end all along. Okay, then why on earth wasn't the whole series in third-person voice, or at least in dual perspective as we had in Book Three with Tris and Four speaking? It's clear that Roth had certain philosophical goals here, but she could have met these goals easily without resorting to such a ridiculous solution.At the end of the day, some \"rules\" for writing exist because to break them means disaster, and that's pretty much what we have here. The story itself had other issues, but none are as significant as the point of view problem.

As I was reading them I felt like I really cared about the characters, connected to them emotionally and struggled to put the books down. So I went into this book with high expectations. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. Normally I really like books that switch up the point of view to multiple characters chapter by chapter, but I didn't enjoy that in this story. I felt like Tris and Tobias were written so similarly in this book that sometimes I forgot which character I was even inside the head of in some chapters. I was so excited about going outside of the city and learning about how and why the factions were set up, but when it all played out it just seemed like a depressing acknowledgement that in the future people are going to continue to be prejudiced and class-ist and repeat the same mistakes we have made over and over in the past.In the first two books I felt a connection and cared deeply for all of the characters that were introduced. For some I had strong positive feelings (Tris, Tobias, Christina etc) and others I strongly disliked (Peter, Tobias's parents ect), regardless I they moved me to want to discuss them and the books and talk about it and think about it even when I wasn't reading. In this third book I cared very little about any of the new characters that were introduced.SpoilersThe end of the story was such a disappointment. I am not one of the reviewers who is angry that Tris died... if it was necessary for the story for her to ultimately die then I am on board for that... However in this story I don't feel that it was written in a way that made that necessary. I see her sacrificing herself for her brother, showing her forgiveness and not just throwing her life away like she may have earlier in the series, but it still felt like a waste. It was so anticlimactic and there are no repercussions for those involved, they just have their memories erased absolving them of the crime. On the other hand with Tobias it seems like everything just turns around for no reason with his mother. The whole trouble could have been avoided by just having a conversation between them and she would give it all up like that?  That is so cheap and easy and makes all the deaths appear to have happened in vain and been totally avoidable. That feels like a slap in the face when you deeply cared for those characters.Good things- I continue to love the references to Chicago and the Midwest where I am from, so cool to have a character from Peoria when I live 10 minutes away.

The problem is, they're so lightweight and senseless that it's hard to remember the nondescript characters and convoluted yet nonsensical plots between books.  I read these books because my granddaughter loves them.  This third novel purports to explain the reasons for the factions and battles in the Divergent and Insurgent.  It doesn't make sense and it doesn't hold together.  When I read the first two novels, it struck me as odd that no one in the fenced-in dystopian Chicago had any curiosity whatsoever about the world outside the fence.  Where did they get gasoline?  Where was their electricity generated?  Where did they get coffee?  Or fresh vegetables in winter?  It seemed to me that they were a pretty dull bunch, Erudition notwithstanding.  No wonder they didn't question their ridiculous faction system.  It never occurred to them that they weren't the only people in the world?  That their city couldn't possibly be self-sufficient? I guess if they were actually smart or curious, they might be forced to ask questions that would point out the thinness of the plot premises.Now, there are a bunch of faction kids from Chicago have gone outside the gate, all the way to the government Genetic Welfare \"compound\" at O'Hare Airport.  They travel by truck--they don't have to fend for themselves for even ten minutes, although of course people are trying to kill them.  This compound, which still flies planes, is a few minutes outside of the fenced-in city where they lived, yet they've never seen an airplane and don't know about air travel--although it appears that the planes fly close enough to Chicago to drop vaporized serum over the city. I guess it never occurred to them to wonder about that silver cylinder with wings cruising in the sky.  Why should they?  They don't wonder about anything else either.Needless to say, there's some romantic strife between Tris and Tobias.  And an epic battle, where the faction kids outwit everyone and never wonder at their good luck:  they need to go down a restricted hallway to the most secret weapon storage?  No problem.  No guards will challenge them.  Need to learn how to make and detonate bombs? No problem, and it only takes a couple of minutes!  Although they're newbies to the facility, they have no problems finding trusted allies immediately.  They can sneak out and back in with impunity.  Need weapons?  Easy peasy.As has been mentioned in other posts--this story is told in the voices of both Tris and Tobias.  The problem is, there's no difference between their voices.  Not one iota.  The device is a little more confusing than it needs to be.The purported explanation of the factions in Chicago is silly and convoluted.  The threat to the future of the people of Chicago is contrived.

I was pleasantly surprised by it and looked forward to the next two books. Insurgent was disappointing, but I chalked that up to the \"sophomore curse\" and expected Allegiant to be far better. It's not--in fact, it's a very poor effort.The problem with the book is not the ending. I can get on board with the choice Roth makes--in the abstract. For that to work, however, the rest of the book has to be totally on point. Instead, it's a mess, with way too many new characters, too much exposition, and too much internalizing by the characters. There were times when I just wished the characters would DO something, anything. When they did, it was usually violence that had little point to it except to kill off characters Roth failed to make me care about.Unfortunately, because of the controversy about the ending, some famous authors are defending Roth as \"brave.\" What she did is not \"brave\" within the context of an intensely mediocre book. Now looking back on it, it's clear to me the potential of the first book was never realized, making the entire series a misfire.I LIKE books--especially books about war--to NOT pull punches and to have the guts to make readers suffer.

But, this story was so different in pace, in writing style etc that i felt i was reading a completely different series!I didn't mind the switching POV but like many, I sometimes forgot or lost track of who's voice we were hearing.  And the ending was epic---epically bad.  The tension and even the likability of the main couple was lost.  I was no longer rooting for them and felt that it was dragging in chapters towards the end.  While I don't require every book I read to have a HEA,  I did feel that Tris' death was not necessary and did not serve the overall storyline.I don't feel that this was the worst book I have ever read, but its certainly the worst ending to a promising and beautiful crafted series.

{"reviewTime": "01 13, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "First off,  full disclosure here,  I am not a professional or even amateur book reviewer.What I want to do with this review is tell you how I felt about the purchase of this product.When I bought this book,  I knew the following:1. The target audience of the book is teenage level readers.  This would include adults looking for some very casual reading.2. I enjoyed reading the other 2 books (solid 4 stars, if not a bit better).3.  Lots of folks love the book,  lots of people hate the book,  far fewer  take a more neutral stance.Having that in mind, I still wanted to finish reading the series, so I spent the $7  for the Kindle download and began reading.My thoughts...1.  Allegiant  is NOT a literary masterpiece (nor was it meant to be.  Newer Author,  targeting teens).2.  The story line gets a little 'weird' at times,  there were a couple of times I had to overlook 'flaws' (an opinion, of course) and keep on reading.3.  The first two books were more enjoyable to me (Divergent being the one I enjoyed the most)4.  I have no problem what-so-ever with the ending.  A  personal statement, not a literary critique.5.  At no point while reading this book did I get bored and want to quit reading based on the writing.  A few parts were \"just okay\" though.6.  Allegiant is very differently written than the other two books.7.  Finally,  I liked reading the series.  Not nearly as much as Hunger Games or Harry Potter  (other teenage target series), but not terrible either.Why 4 Stars?1 star = 'I hate it'  - Not True.2 stars = 'I don't like it'  - Not True either,  I did enjoy it.3.stars = 'Just Okay'  There are lots of just okay moments in the book.  Might fit.4 stars = 'I liked it'  There are lots of moments in the book I do like. Might fit.5 stars = 'I love it'  - Not really true either.So, in the end,  I would really like to give a satisfaction rating for Allegiant of 3.5 stars.  However, I have to choose though between 3 or 4 stars.  In the end, I 'liked' the book (and certainly the series) and the $7  spent was a good value for the entertainment.", "reviewerName": "D.

{"reviewTime": "02 5, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I have three things to say about the Divergent Series.1) It's a lot of fun for 2 and 3/4 books.2) The last 1/4 of the last book stunk and ruined the entire series.3) The love story is cheesy and gives the 11 to 14 year olds reading the series a skewed and inappropriate idea of what first love is like.I always say that a book or a book series (which is really just one long book broken into parts) is only as good as its ending. What you are left with when you close the cover on the end means more than all the stuff that came before.  As fun as the story of Tris, Tobias, and friends was, it means nothing when the ending makes me wish I hadn't read it at all.You know what the kicker is? I even knew it was coming. I never, NEVER read spoilers. But this ONE time I did. I always wait to start a series until the last book has been written--I hate cliffhangers and waiting years for them to be resolved.  I knew Divergent had a ton of fans and I was just waiting for the final book to come out, but when it did and the reviews were horrible I decided to investigate. I didn't want to read something I was going to hate! When I realized what had even the most passionate fans ready to rumble, I decided I wouldn't even start. But then Amazon went and had them as a Kindle Daily Deal and I couldn't resist. I wish I had. So there's that.My other gripe is a bit harder for me to put into words. I read books both for me and for my kids. I want them to love getting lost in a story as much as I do.  I know first hand how powerful words can be, especially how words in books can shape perspective, understanding, and expectations of things that someone has never experienced for themselves.  If you have never been to Alaska read \"The Snow Child\" and you'll feel like you grew up there.  Want to know what it's like living in small-town Mississippi? Read a John Grisham novel.  Want to know how it felt to experience the 9/11 terrorist attacks in Manhattan? Read \"Peace in Amber\" and you'll think you were there.  Its been 17 years, but I still to this day think I know what's it's like to be an 11-year-old girl because I read \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret\" when I was 10.  I still remember how I felt when I read a book nearly 20 years ago, and has shaped me! So, do I want my 12-year-old daughter to learn what first love is like by reading about Tris (who is 16, has never even held a boy's hand, yet can navigate romance with the skill of a seasoned adult) and Tobias (who is 18, never had a girlfriend, and has super human control over his hormones)? No! No! No!  Their relationship is not real.  I'm sad for these young children who read about Tris climbing in bed with Tobias wearing only a T-shirt and underwear, wrapping her legs around him under the covers, making out with passion and feeling, rubbing hands on hips and up and down bare backs, and then chastly falling asleep together, Tobias protecting Tris from her bad dreams. So romantic! So ideal! So not real! Someone who has experienced love can filter the fantasy from the reality. But children who have Tris and Tobias to thank for their first experience with love are going to be disappointed when their expectations fail to meet with their reality. So, as much as my daughters and sons may want to read the Divergent Series, I'm going to insist they wait.In fact, I'm going to be suggesting the skip the Divergent Series all together.", "reviewerName": "D.

The first two books in the series were great-full of raw emotions, tension, energy and details lots of details.  This final installment seemed like it was written by a different person. The dialogue was stilted and forced. Someone else mentioned that without titles on the chapters it was often difficult to tell who was speaking and that is very true. I found myself repeatedly going back to check the title of a chapter because I couldn't tell who was talking much of the time because everyone sounded the same. The characters were flat, underdeveloped and I didn't really feel anything about any of them. The premise of GDs and GPs felt like a lecture on human nature. Too much time was spent on that explanation (which sounds odd because there really weren't many actual details) and not enough time on character interaction and development. Except for a few characters we didn't get to know any of the people living in the compound or the fringe.  This book felt rushed to print and I wish I had stopped after the first two-which I thoroughly enjoyed and didn't want to put down. I had to force myself to finish reading it and found myself skimming the final chapters in boredom. To be fair I went back and forced myself to read them completely but still felt the same-bored. Very disappointing ending to what started out as a great series. I need to add to my original review. Its not all about Tris dying or not dying as so many people are complaining about. That  has nothing to do with my review. Its about the overall construction of the third book. Compared to the first two it is flat and two dimensional.The plot, the pacing, the repetitive narrative. It left me feeling bored, cheated, disappointed. I will follow an author's idea anywhere as long as the ride is a quality work of writing.

{"reviewTime": "11 2, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "After reading Insurgent I wasn&#8217;t expecting to be wowed by Allegiant, and unfortunately my expectations were right.Roth is excellent at writing action and suspense. The scenes with the Allegiant getting ambushed while trying to leave the city, Tris, George and Amar being attacked while visiting &#8220;the fringe&#8221; and  Tris and Caleb trying to breach the weapons lab were good, not as good as some of the action sequences in Divergent and Insurgent, but good enough to keep this reader engaged.However, outside of the very few &#8220;action&#8221; scenes, the conclusion of this series was uninspiring.Tris &#8211; Totally preachy, self-centered and self-righteous. Her 'I am always right. I always know what to do. I can&#8217;t forgive him, Caleb, for joining Erudite and leaving me,' attitude made her character even more unlikeable than she was in Insurgent. Though her POV talked about her pain and sometimes confusion over all that had happened, I never believed it. The words were on the page, but there was no feeling behind them. I didn't see or feel Tris' pain. She had no reaction to the truth about Divergent, which was a word she&#8217;d strongly embraced and used to define herself. She had no reaction Edith Prior's message except one that served the plot eta., her near obsession with going outside the city without very little thought about why they should do that and what they may encounter outside of their own world. She had no reaction to Caleb's impending execution until it served the plot. Her choices didn't feel organic. Instead they felt like a list of things the author needed to check off for her to do before she finally made the ultimate choice of self-sacrifice. As a result, Tris didn&#8217;t come off as real, and therefore became unrelateable. When she died I was somewhat surprised the author went there, though the last morning she spent with Tobias and  Roth choosing to do this last book in two POVs should&#8217;ve been a sign that one of the two narrators were going to die. I didn&#8217;t feel anything when Tris died. Her death seemed preachy with her continuous thoughts about how sacrificing herself for those she loved was what true sacrifice was.  It was disappointing because this was a character I really enjoyed in Divergent.Tobias &#8211; He was by far my favorite character in the series, but in Allegiant he became a shell of his former self. His voice was not any different from Tris&#8217;. It was the same tone, the same word use, the same everything. Furthermore, he turned into a completely different character.  I always got the impression that he never put much stock in being defined as Divergent, yet when he learns that he isn&#8217;t and is thus &#8220;genetically damaged,&#8221; he becomes insecure, reckless and even more brooding. I found no interest in his mending relationship with his mother, because there was no effort put into that relationship except when it served the plot.  I thought it would&#8217;ve made more sense to explore resolving his issues with Marcus, his father, since this man had been a presence in Tobias/Four psyche since the first book. Yet Marcus was just kept around as a minor plot device before disappearing completely, without explanation, when the writer had no more use for him. Despite the poorly written POV of Tobias I still cared about this character. I was pleased that he lived (and that he may end up with Christina), but similar to Tris&#8217; POV I didn&#8217;t feel like his final words were organic. It felt as if he was speaking to the reader, telling the reader the true meaning of bravery and survival. It took me out of the story and made me feel as if the author, not Tobias was speaking at this point.Tris/Tobias &#8211;  I couldn&#8217;t  have cared less about their relationship, which is sad considering it was much of the center of Divergent. There was chemistry there, a hotness that jumped off the page in the first book, when these two interacted and there was respect, much of which was lost in Insurgent. In Allegiant, everything that made this couple interesting was completely gone. Though Roth, I&#8217;m sure, intended for their relationship to come off as two young individuals going through the difficulties of being in love and in a relationship, it came off as two individuals who were just doing the only thing they knew to do, the only thing that remained familiar in their ever changing world which was to be together. I didn&#8217;t feel the love, respect or potential that this relationship represented in the first book. When they said they loved each other I didn&#8217;t believe it. When they said the other was their life, I didn&#8217;t believe it. The words were there, but the warmth was missing from their interactions, which made their relationship tedious. When they were on the verge of breaking up and when Tris died, I just didn&#8217;t care about her brief moment of pain over never seeing Tobias again or how he&#8217;d be devastated over her death.  Like many of the characters in this book, Tobia and Tris&#8217; relationship was a shell of its former self. It was no longer viable and should&#8217;ve ended long before Tris&#8217; death.The experiment (genetically damaged vs. genetically pure) &#8211; Was one of the most convoluted and contrived things I&#8217;ve ever read. Granted, I could understand Roth&#8217;s desired commentary on prejudice, bravery and humans desire to play God and fix what isn&#8217;t broke. However, the execution just didn&#8217;t make sense. The science was completely unbelievable, and the characters reactions, or lack thereof, to the lies that was their lives and who they were didn&#8217;t ring true. Lastly, the resolution being Chicago becoming this Utopia where the genetically damaged and genetically pure could live in peace and harmony was completely implausible. If the culture of the United States was that the government/genetically pure believed that the genetically damaged were menaces who were not worthy of rights and respect, would they really standby and let Chicago turn into this Utopia for all?I think the original concept of Divergent was interesting and likely could&#8217;ve been managed had the concept been kept simple. However, with Roth adding in government experiments and conspiracies, civil wars, societies within societies, it just got too big. It was impossible to keep a coherent story with so much going on. Perhaps this story should&#8217;ve been spread out into several books so the characters and the world they lived in could be properly fleshed out. Unfortunately that is not what happened, and as a result what started out as a promising series ended up being a severe disappointment.", "reviewerName": "DNW", "summary": "An Uninspiring Close to the Divergent Series", "helpful": [9, 10], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383350400, "reviewerID": "AXGLPRDXGCQ2Z"}

{"reviewTime": "03 29, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "This is a hard review for me to write because I loved the first two books so much. Did I enjoy this book? Kinda. Was I shocked and left with unsettled feelings? YES! As with the previous books in the series the emotional investment is pretty intense. Maybe that&#8217;s why this one has the most impact on me, but not necessary in a good way. Perhaps I was too emotionally caught up in the lives of the characters and the twist in this, the last look into their lives, was more than a little disquieting.ALLEGIANT begins where INSURGENT ended. There is a continuation that would have been fluid if not for the jarring use of two first person voices. This doesn&#8217;t normally bother me and I actually enjoy it in quite a few books I&#8217;ve read. Not the case here. Found it difficult to remember whose take on the story I was reading in several different points throughout the novel. Despite the confusion of which one was doing the talking, once again Tris and Tobais consume my total attention, as do all the characters in the story. There is a richness in each personality that isn't always seen in other books. I found myself invested in what was going to happen to them and what they were going to become embroiled in. The realism comes across, even if the story is unimaginable. But sometimes realism isn&#8217;t always a good thing. The buildup as to what is going to be found beyond the fence was so well done. The reality of what they find I wasn&#8217;t so happy with. Parts of it worked but larger parts were disappointing.  As in the first two books, there are no punches held. Perhaps that is what makes all the stories so consuming. Knowing that nothing and no one is sacred brings an intensity and tension that&#8217;s tangible. If you have already read the first two books in the series you are going to have to read ALLEGIANT. I&#8217;m happy I read this but find myself left with mixed feelings as to the ending, heck, to the whole book. Maybe this is the only way for the story to end in Ms. Roth&#8217;s mind. She definitely left me with my feelings in turmoil and maybe that is what she intended.RECOMMEND to anyone 15 and older.

Due to her resistance to truth serum, she is able to lie and get herself and her friends of the hook. But, life in the city is almost as worse as before. The factionless have taken control, and have demolished all the factions. Now that they are out of the shadows, the factionless are ruling the people by force and declaring the video Tris released as a lie.Tris, Tobias, and a few close friends decide the only place left for them is outside the city walls. However, when they leave they find the world waiting for them has as many problems as the city they just left. Years of genetic manipulation has left the human population at odds with one another. \"Purity Wars\" were fought and millions died. Now, the genetically pure lead things, with the genetically damaged seen as second class citizens.As Tris and Tobias learn about the world they've escaped into, they see the injustice running rampant and join forces to help the GD (genetically damaged). Things get hairy when they learn of the Bureau's plot to wipe out all the memories of everyone left in the factionless city and reprogram them to be different people.My Thoughts-A great ending to an action-packed trilogy. Wow, this book really tied together all the loose ends, both emotionally and physically. The story switches back and forth between Tris and Tobias' POV's. We see Tris as she learns that her genetic defects have healed, and Tobias as he is declared genetically damaged. Both struggle to relate to the new world and find their places in it. I have to admit that I often got confused about whose POV I was in. Tris and Tobias are so alike that it would catch me by surprise to find myself thinking I was in one of their heads, when in fact I was in the other.Though not as action packed as the previous two books, this one is full of emotional drama. I didn't miss the action as I learned about the world that was outside the city. The idea of genetic manipulation is feasible for our day and age, and reading about the results and the deluded secrets of the people left in charge was hard, because I could see it happening in real life.The ending is a big shocker. I wasn't ready for it, and when it happened I was in disbelief.

I guess it didn't hit me reading the first two books just how limited their little world is.  They know NOTHING beyond the borders of their home.  They didn't even have a name for their city.  What really struck me was how they never really thought to question the borders of where they're from and if they hadn't stumbled upon Edith Prior's message, they probably never would have.This book was fast paced, exciting, sad, revelatory, and ultimately hopeful.  There's been a lot of talk about how people didn't like the way it ended, and I'll leave it to you to determine your own feelings on the matter, but I understood why Roth did what she did and ended the story how she did because, to me, it was genuine.

Don't make this mysterious, strong hunk of a man sound like a weenier. Keep the Tobias we all new and loved going, don't make him so weak on the inside. He became uninteresting and he started to sound like Tris. Now I KNOW my boyfriend and I do not have the same thought process or ways of speaking, you'd know who was thinking what immediately.

Tris escaped everything that happened in \"Chicago\" AND a death serum but David is the one that manages to kill her off?? It was SO unnecessary!!

It sounded thrown together and so not thought out. VR has shown that she is an amazing writer that can create interesting story lines but this book was hardly interesting.Fouth...So they can shut down an entire city with memory serum and death serum and have serums to create complete hallucinations but they haven't created something to CURE a COMA!

I will however say that it did not deliver a good ending to a great story. Beware there are spoilers!The first two books were great, I devoured them and couldn't put them down. Though the writing was easy to follow, I could also not identify when Tris and Tobias were narrating the story, I had to go back to see who it was! Now, I love the parallel narrator but I don't think it was executed properly.I hate the fact that Tris died, I saw no point to it whatsoever!! I get the sacrifice, but to be killed by bullets after surviving the serum, that's just ridiculous and pointless. She could have (and should have) fired before he did. She had done it before, she was skilled and smart, though her plan doesn't suggest it, but the rest of well executed story before this book does.I also hate how Tobias changes from this perfect strong man into a girl, literally he lost his entire identity and becomes annoying to read! I loved him strong and smart, but then it didn't make sense!!! He got lost somewhere for no reason, just like the characters were dropping dead for no good reaso... I also think he should have gone through his fear landscape one last time, as a close. He overcame all his fears! (Zip lining at the end counts!) It would have been fantastic for him to live through as a sign of acceptance and moving on.I thought at first the story was going to make sense, and for a whole it did, although it fell flat at some point.

After Insurgent's cliff hanger I really wanted to know WHAT COMES NEXT???? Man was I disappointed.I looked at the rating of this book before I read it and compared to the other two the ratings for Allegiant were not so good. I ignored what people said about it being awful. I should have listened.I honestly believe anyone who gave this book more than 2 stars did so out of respect for the first two books. Allegiant is where Roth's storyline and good writing came to die. This book frustrates me so much that I almost wish I would never have started reading the series. (honestly the only read I did was because my husband who never reads, read Divergent in one day and could not stop talking about how good it was. and with the wonderful technology of kindles I decided to read along with him and surpassed him..... I wish I wouldn't have because it would have saved me a lot of time and disappointment).The first part that truly frustrated me about this book was that she wrote it in BOTH Tris' perspective and Tobias' perspective I think if that was something she was going to do it should have been like that from the start. She also never changed writing styles at all and I kept getting confused on who's head I was in and would have to continuously re-read chapters. I have read plenty of books with dual (or more) perspectives and never had this much trouble keep person to person straight.******SPOILER ALERT***************SPOILER ALERT*********Then when it comes to the actual events of the book.Most of the situations that Tris was presented with were redundant. It appears the only change was you were able to read Tobias' point of view during this time also. I mean how many times can Tris and Tobias argue about trust..... apparently too many.How many times can Tris tell Tobias that a person is lying to him and he shouldn't believe them, and then he still goes against what she says....... again apparently too many. This difference this time was that Tobais' ally caused Uriah's death, which causes Tobias a lot of guilt.Tris is an annoying know it all and if people don't agree with her she gives them the cold shoulder. And then as if to prove her point she is ALWAYS right. No one can be right that often.The part that I loathed the most is that Roth killed Tris off in one of her acts of selflessness when Tris decided to go on the suicide mission that Caleb was supposed to go on in retribution for his betrayal. I understand that Roth may have wanted to make this books &#34;realistic&#34; but why start with killing off the main character? This was just plain stupid. This is supposed to be  Young Adult fiction, in my experience that usually means a happy ending for the main character....... NOT KILL HER OFF!And lets be honest I do read books and expect happy endings. Who in their right minds allows the &#34;evil&#34; characters live and not the main character?Peter gets to start over after having his memory reset.Marcus just disappears.Caleb get to live.David has no negative consequences for his actions other than having his memory reset.And then the war between the Factionless and the Allegiant just fizzles out with an agreement that Marcus no longer be a leader. How anticlimactic.The only way I will ever encourage anyone to read this series (not just book because lets be honest if you start a series you want to see how it ends) is if Roth decided to create an alternate ending where Tris lives.

The second book was okay, it advanced the plot some and was overall satisfying.  After all, you expect the 2nd book to be filler, progression of story, etc.  If you're excited to know what happens in the 3rd book as I was, don't read it.  The plot line is just silly.

The characters don't progress at all (however much the author wants you to believe that was her focus).  The dialog and interpersonal situations are all things you've read in the previous 2 books, nothing new there and it becomes dull due to the repetition.  Then my biggest complaint (not the ending!) was the point of view alternating between Tris and Four.  She wrote the two characters so similarly and the two characters have been together the previous 2 books so have had all the same experiences that without the chapter headers you wouldn't even know who was narrating.  What happened to the great Tris from the first book?  I guess she got stuck in a bad plot and then...(well everyone should know by now what happens).  I suspect the author put in Four's perspective so she could have him end the book.  I really wasn't even interested in reading his last chapters, but after putting time in the series, I persevered.  What a disappointment.  Perhaps she was up to her deadline, but I don't understand why her editor and the numerous people who read this before publication didn't send her back to the drawing board.

I feel in general that the series went down hill from the first. Don't get me wrong--I was entertained. But there were some issues, too.On a positive note? We find out what's going on, big picture. I like that. Except it opens doors to bigger pictures, like what is going on internationally? In our world, everything is becoming so internationalized, I can't believe this USA is so isolated as to not effect the rest of the world.The character development in this one was not as good. What made Divergent so good was Tris and her uniquely human character. She was imperfect and that made her a great character. But this one was all roses and butterflies--cheesy love scenes and easy make ups. I suppose she may have grown as a character, but part of who she was included being impulsive, unforgiving, survivalist. I like the idea of switching perspectives, but I agree with every other review that comments the two POVs were completely indistinguishable. Often I would get confused and have to go back and check which POV I was reading because I was thinking it was a different one (I am a fast reader and skimped the title pages of the chapters a bit, I suppose). But if I have to check, then how can I tell if the characters are different. It felt more like a third person narrative from two POVs, written in first person.SPOILER--As for her dying, I guess I'm conflicted. Part of me thinks that was kind of necessary to make it not a perfect ending. Part of me thinks it's kind of crappy. I like the idea posed by one reader to have had the memory serum work on her, but that doesn't mesh with her resistance to other serums.

I&#8217;ve loved this series from the first chapter of Divergent, book one. Just when I thought nothing could top Divergent, out came Insurgent, which was even better than book one. So I had high expectations for Allegiant, the third and final installment from Veronica Roth, even though I was really nervous too.I was excited when I first learned that Allegiant would be written from two points of view, those of Tris and Four. A chance to get into Four&#8217;s head! Who wouldn&#8217;t love that? But the transition to an alternating point of view for the third book was awkward for me. I didn&#8217;t find the voices of Tris and Four distinct enough. A few times I forgot whose head I was in and I had to flip back to the chapter heading to confirm. This was a problem for me throughout the book. The chapters were all generally short and didn&#8217;t give me enough time to get comfortable in any character&#8217;s head before popping into an alternating view point.Despite this problem, Allegiant had nonstop action and gut wrenching emotion. Let me repeat that. Gut. Wrenching. Emotion. The kind of emotion that tears your heart out, steps on it a few times then runs it over with a truck. As I got closer to the ending, I found myself reading slower, trying to savor the final words of this series, willing it not to end because I knew how much I&#8217;d miss this world. But the world that Veronica Roth gave us in book one is not the world we are left with in book three and in some ways that made saying goodbye easier, because the characters also had to say goodbye to the world that captivated me throughout this series.Even though I felt some of the plot lines were a bit contrived and forced, Allegiant did what the final book in a series is supposed to do; give us closure. All of the characters traveled full story arcs and completed their journeys.

(I won't bother to summarize the plot, as so many reviews have already done that.)First of all, it's incredibly hard to keep the two perspectives--those of Tris and Tobias--separate. They sound exactly the same, and I often had to flip back to see who was talking. That being said, they hardly resemble the characters they were in the first two books. Tris is no longer spunky and impulsive, and Tobias is no longer brave and hardened--they're just bland.Second, the author spent way too much time exploring the genetically damaged/genetically pure plotline she introduced. Besides the improbability of that plotline, it totally discredits and undermines the impact of the first two books. What were Tris and Tobias and their city even fighting for or against, if it all came down to an experiment? And how is it that no one bothered to go beyond the fence before? I would have liked to know a lot more about the political dynamics beyond the Bureau, and the war and situation in the Fringe. It felt like the Fringe was just plopped in as convenient, to move the plot along, when really it was the most interesting part of the book.In Divergent and Insurgent, the author created an interesting world that I found entertaining, even if I didn't always find the characters very well-rounded (it was no Hunger Games, which in my opinion is far superior).

The first two books were beautifully set up. But this third book, it was just different. I will try really hard not to give spoilers in this review but that might be hard. If there are spoilers coming they shall be labeled.Let's start with things I enjoyed about this book, because there truly were quite a few. I LOVED the fact that the relationship in this book deals with the idea that relationships aren't easy. People lie, get jealous, make stupid decisions and a whole lot of other things. While the issues weren't handled in a terribly realistic manner, the fact that they were addressed at all was impressive. Also, I really enjoyed the fact that the build up that occurred in the first two books was addressed and I guess &#34;resolved&#34; in this last book. While I am definitely not a fan of the way it was resolved I applaud Veronica Roth for taking a chance and ending a book in what might not be the popular option. She took a risk and stuck to her guns and I can respect that.So one of the issues I had with this book was the introduction of the dual perspectives. In the first two books the story was told solely from Tris' perspective. But Allegiant was told from the perspectives of both Four and Tris. The transition between the two was hard to discern but I got used to it eventually. It was just a bit startling at the beginning of the book.The biggest problems I had with this book was the end. While I can see the reasoning behind her choice in ending the trilogy the way she did, I still wish it would have ended differently. I just...I was expecting something so totally and completely different. While this ending is better than the open-ended ending that I thought was coming I'm still not okay with it. I don't know if I am the only one who feels this way but ya. As I said above I applaud Veronica Roth for sticking to her guns and making a choice that she felt was right for the trilogy.

{"reviewTime": "02 19, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I really think the Divergent series was all over the place. When I say all over the place I mean that I didn&#8217;t consistently enjoy myself or the storyline.  Allegiant itself was all over the place, but what I love about each book in the series is that Veronica Roth knows how to end a book in a way that kind of blows your mind. The ending of Allegiant especially blew my mind in a big way. No spoiler. Just go read it so you know what I mean.What I loved about Allegiant:I love that we finally discover the reason why Chicago is fenced in.I love that we get an idea of what is outside of the fence.I love learning more about Tris&#8217; family and how they came to be.I love the major choice Marcus has to make and how that turns out.I love that the &#8220;villains&#8221; got theirs.I love that the ending was not quite what I had expected.What I didn&#8217;t love about Allegiant:Not enough information was provided concerning what the world outside Chicago is like. I would have liked to see more interaction between the characters and the world.The relationship between Caleb and Tris. I understand that their relationship is strained  and I understand why that is, but I hate that it doesn&#8217;t really ever feel mended.I didn&#8217;t love how little most of the characters were involved.

{"reviewTime": "01 6, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Veronica Roth is a phenomenal writer. Despite anything and everything said on the contrary, especially in regards to 'Allegiant', you just can't deny it. Or, at least, I couldn't while finishing the Divergent series, and still can't, hours later.Allegiant, the final installment of the 'Divergent' series, begins with the characters we know and love, coming to terms with the video they've just seen. Aparently the whole faction system, their whole city is part of a big experiement controlled by people outside of Amity fences, to breed a large enough Divergent population. When you put into contrast, the first and final books, the plotline has changed drastically. It's just like admiring one particular section of a painting, and then slowly backing up to see the whole picture. Roth does this in such a subtle way, that you wouldn't notice the drastic change until you really looked into both books. Her ability to do so is truly commendable.Another thing I noticed about the plot of Allegiant was 1) how smoothly the story ran, and 2) how, in every chapter, was something significant. The first is pretty self-explanatory, no parts of the book felt unnecessarily prolonged nor was any part too fast-paced. The second, however, could use some further explaining. What I meant was, that out of the fifty-six chapters that make up this book, none of them felt like fillers. A filler is a chapter that does absolutely nothing for the plot, character development and so on, and they're found in almost every book nowadays. But I didn't think Allegiant had any of those. Every chapter made sense, and felt necessary.&#34;The world beyong ours is full of roads and dark buildings and collapsing power lines.&#34;- TrisOne thing that the first book, Divergent, sort of lacked, was impressive world building. I don't think I have to stress how important it is for a YA dystopian to have good world building. We, the readers, have to know the world doesn't exist, but believe that it could exist. In Divergent, only the Dauntless compound was thoroughly explored. In Allegiant, everything from the city's history, to the Bureau outside of the city, was built so well.After Tris, Four and the gang leave the city, and are taken to the Bureau by Amar, descriptions go through the roof. Not in such a way that you're overwhelmed with description after description, but rather, that you don't have to try so hard to imagine the world you're reading about, it comes naturally. That's something I really enjoyed about this book, because ultimately, your reading experience is made so much more fun.&#34;I'm sick of doing bad things and liking it and then wondering what's wrong with me. I want it to be over. I want to start again.&#34;- PeterOh my God, the character development in this book is unbelievable! Like.. holy crap!Tris is now my favourite heroine, of all time, and that's saying a whole lot! Who thought the fragile little protagonist of Divergent would ever turn out to be such a strong and mature, leader in what, a year? And Roth's bringing this transformation to life, I thought, was just so impressive. For me, one of the key moments when I just knew Tris' had really grown up, was later on in the book, with her forgiving Four. After the fight they had, and Four's participating in Nita's plan, I thought they were done for good. I was impressed when Tris actually understood that they stay together because they make each other better people and whatnot.Also, it wasn't just Tris' character who's development was more than impressive. I felt like most characters across the board were well developed, from Christina, to Cara, to Peter, to Caleb, and most of all, Tobias. Any character who, in my opinion, needed to be fleshed out, was fleshed out and it was done effortlessly. Nearing the end of the story, after all the tragedies, the most significant of all took place; Tobias. I have no uncertainty in my saying that Four has changed so much, there's little resemblence between his character in Divergent and the finale, Allegiant. In the beginning of the book I didn't actually like how much he had changed, because he seemed too vulnerable, but it worked out perfectly at the end.&#34;'Oh, are we at the insult part of the breakup?' she says. 'Because I got in a lot of practice after what happened with Will. I have several choice things to say about her nose'&#34;- CaraMan, did Roth's writing improve after writing 'Insurgent'! Seriously, I went through Allegiant, thinking to myself, that the writing techniques and styles were so much better this time around!My review of Insurgent made it obvious that I was disappointed with the ending. With Allegiant, despite all the controversial opinions, I still think it ended perfectly. I don't want to spoil anything, because part of my enjoyment was due to the sheer surprise, but yeah, I thought Roth made the right decision. Sure, she could have ended it another way, but it wouldn't have been as memorable. If I say anything else, I will end up letting something slip, so I'll just leave it at that.I think some people may be mis-reviewing this book, based more on how they didn't appreciate the surprise at the end. Me, on the other hand, thoroughly enjoyed it, in all it's heart-wrenching glory.", "reviewerName": "Emmanuel Okoye", "summary": "Allegiant Book Review", "helpful": [0, 5], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1388966400, "reviewerID": "A1QIJKD7VX1JC4"}

The whole base of the faction society is in question and Tris is one of the few who is willing to get to the bottom of things, no matter the cost.Honestly, I mentally prepared myself for Allegiant weeks before I read it. Everyone in the Divergent fandom pretty much heard that the ending was basically going to blow you out of the water. Then, to add to it all, there was the hype of Four also narrating. It's pretty easy to say that expectations were very high.Tris and Four each took turns narrating for us, and after reading The Transfer, I was really excited. Four's voice was completely different from Tris's in the latter. However, in Allegiant the first or second POV changes were fine, Four's voice was just as I remembered. But after the third or fourth time, their voices just started blending together. So that was a bit of a let down.The plot was.... not expected but not unexpected either. For me, some of the magic was kind of lost when Tris and Four go beyond the fence and learn the truth. At that point, it was just the work and world building from the previous two books that kept Allegiant from feeling just like every other dystopian out there. Don't get me wrong, it was different but also a bit similar. Then there's the fact that Four is a freakin' hypocrite. He and Tris promise (again) to be honest, and he goes off in the night, learns something important, and doesn't tell her when he should. Four was... frustrating.As for Tris, I loved her. She really grew. I do feel that her recovery from all of the emotional trauma suffered in Insurgent was a bit rushed. But Tris returned as a strong and more honest character in Allegiant. And I would say, finished her journey and fulfilled purpose.The ending was the most traumatic thing I have ever read. I was trying not to cry for the last sixty or so pages. I know some people were angry but that wasn't my reaction at all. I'll admit that I wish things hadn't ended the way they did. It definitely wasn't the ending I wanted. But Miss Roth handled it all very well if you ask me. Now that its been a few weeks since I finished, I see the symbolism behind this traumatic event. It brought this character full circle.

Wow!Roth finished what she started and finished it well.  Taking up Tris' tale and adding in a new perspective from Tobias, she continued to supply plenty of perfectly paced action, soul-searching dilemmas, and her hallmark plot twists.  Though like life the story doesn't always go where the reader would like it to go, the plot line stays unforgivingly true to the characters and their next logical steps.

Although the setting is alien to us, Roth manages to give the gist without time-wasting explanations.I will be recommending this book and its two precedents enthusiastically to all, especially young adults.

The revelation about what the divergent actually are was kind of a let down.  The factions being a form of behavior modification was not explained well and didn't make sense to me.  It was a weak explanation of how the world of factions that existed in the first two books could come to be.  And most of all I don't think killing Tris was necessary or a good idea.  I think the situation in reverse would have been better.  The plan being for Tris to go in and set off the memory serum becuase she had a chance of survival and then at the last minute Caleb stepping in and sacrificing himself.  We already knew Tris would sacrifice herself for others, she did it several times in the previous books.  It also might have shown that the GDs weren't so damaged after all.The book was bad enough and the ending shocking enough that I actually wondered if the author did it on purpose.

{"reviewTime": "10 22, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "As I write this review, I'm still in shock. Not because Allegiant was horrible, but quite the opposite--it was good, it was realistic, it was unexpected, and oh my goodness, it was emotional. I'm still reeling from the ending. Just my saying that might have some of you guessing at what the ending could be, but you'll probably still be surprised (well, unless you already read a spoiler somewhere, of course). I was entirely shocked--I'm not sure I've ever encountered a YA novel that ended quite like Allegiant did. Does it sound arrogant to say I'm proud of Veronica Roth for writing it the way she did? I hope not, because I truly mean it as a compliment. So many authors either avoid reality or plunge too far into it, turning it so tasteless that it's like trying to swallow bitter ash. But Allegiant walks a fine line of bringing those moments that make us giddy and happy, and then reminding us of the seriousness of being a real person in real life.Dang, I loved this book.I wasn't sure at first. Insurgent was good, but not as amazing as Divergent, and of course Allegiant started off in yet another different way, so I had no idea how it would go. Whereas Divergent was almost insta-love, Allegiant was more like falling in love with a best friend who just sort of crept up on you...unexpectedly in some ways, but yet, not so unexpected.I suppose I should actually mention the plot, beyond all these vague hints. I don't want to give too much away, and I think the summary covers the plot just fine, so what I'll do is I'll talk about the questions that are addressed in this book. If you want to know absolutely nothing about the plot and what is answered, stop reading here!So...for the rest of you. Yes, Tris and Tobias finally learn what's outside of their city. They learn where they are, what's been going on in the outside world, and how their faction system originally got set up. We also see what happens to the city they're from, so it's not like the city's totally been left behind. Tris and Tobias have to again make decisions about their values and morals, and they are wonderfully true to character. And I don't mean they keep making the same decisions no matter what, I mean that they change, grow, and make decisions based on both old values and new realizations. Just like any person does. We also get a little bit of an epilogue, which is nice. I'm glad the book didn't just end--I hate when stories do that. Especially considering this ending...yes, it is extremely sad. It will probably have you in tears. You may hate Veronica Roth for a while. But...the fact that the book makes you care so much about the end? I think that's the mark of a good writer.If someone's looking for critiques, the best I can give you is that Tobias has changed from who he was in Divergent, and some fans may not like that, who knows. He's a little less mysterious since the POV switches between him and Tris, and some people might not love seeing more of his tortured soul. Also, some of the science/ scientific ideals seem a little unbelievable to me, but I suppose you have to sort of take that in stride when you're reading a dystopian.But all that aside, it was the writing style, message, and characters that mattered more to me, and I loved all those.

{"reviewTime": "10 22, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "There are no actually stated spoilers in this review, yet they can be inferred.I devoured the first two books in this series when they were released by Harper Collins 18 months ago. They are both wordy and overlong, but I loved them anyway. They were amateur, but that's okay. I enjoy plenty of \"amateur\" books. You know the ones, the ones where the author is untried, hasn't quite found her groove, isn't quite sure how to get her point across.One of the things I loved the most was that the typical formula in YA dystopian books was that the heroine is depressed in the third book and it's painful to get through. Why is that good? Because Insurgent was that book for the Divergent Trilogy. Tris was a wreck in that story. She made foolish decisions, put herself in danger, teased death at every turn. It was depression, hopelessness, recklessness. It was painful, but I was hopeful because if we saw that behaviour in book 2, then book 3 was something to be excited about. There would be growth.Then I was even more excited when I saw that this story was categorized as Teen Romance. So, not only would we see Tris' emotional growth, but there would be relationship growth for Tris and Tobias. After all, romances have \"rules\". They may be unwritten, but they are understood. And people who read romances are ticked if those rules aren't followed.I read the first 12 chapters of Allegiant before I pottered off to bed. I was enjoying it. Getting inside Four's head was a lovely surprise and it seemed that he and Tris were going to figure things out. Before I had a chance to come back to the book I started hearing about negative reviews for the book. One or two and I don't think much of them. But that number was rapidly rising as my morning continued forward. While at the grocery store I stopped before the wall of hardcovers and couldn't stop myself from nabbing one off the shelf. I thumbed to the epilogue, skimmed enough to tell me what was going on, put the book back on the shelf, and then my emotions warred  between anger and hurt.Miss Roth broke one of the cardinal rules of romances. And she broke my trust. I don't care about realism. Life is emotional and sucks as it is. A story can be written where it's realistic in some areas, yet still allows us to hope in others. Quite frankly, life isn't worth it without there being hope. Can hope be argued in this story? Sure. Was the final scene poignant? Yes. I GET it. But that doesn't make it enjoyable. When I read a single book that drags my emotions through the mud, I want a payoff at the end. Something to make it all \"worth it\". Well, that goes triple when I'm dragged through a trilogy. As a reader, you're waiting for that moment. That payoff. Those words that leap off the page as if the author is saying, \"See? You just had to trust me. I made you sad and hurt and ache before, but it's all worth it! See? See!\"Yeah. This book? Not worth it and makes me feel as if I wasted my time rereading Divergent and Insurgent this last week. Wasted my time being excited for MONTHS for Allegiant to come out. Wasted my breath when I told my family and friends about this series. And I never want to feel as if I wasted my time on a book. Do I always like the final installment in a series? No. I can name several where I wasn't thrilled with how a series ended, but Allegiant trumps them all.If you want realism, look out the window and at the world around you. I returned my Kindle copy before getting past chapter 12 and I sure as heck don't want my daughters to read this. I'm deleting the other two books.

I thought, after reading the first book, the series would be about how the factions, while a good idea at first, was not the long term solution. That the divergents were proof that people can't be crammed into a group based off one characteristic that defines your entire life. The 2nd book was predictable. I knew Evelyn was going to end up just like Jeanine from the beginning. What annoyed me the most was Evelyn and the factionless. She wanted to destroy the factions and make everyone equal but she didn't. In the end there was the factionaless and the ex-factions. Instead of 5 groups there were 2. About halfway through I guessed that it was just a government experiment and was disappointed to find out I was right in book 3. It was all to correct gene damage? Pretty much the experiments were to let people breed until there was no longer damage. Wouldn't that have happened without holing people up in a city? I wasn't upset Tris died but how she died. When Nita approached Tobias about how the Bureau finds the GDs to be expendable, I thought not again. Finding out that it was all just another simulation would have been less disappointing than the redundancy of overthrowing another group again. I could have handled the experiment part better if it wasn't just a repeat of Jeanine or if Tris and the rest decided to get revenge and burn the place down.

Once I got to chapter four, I was slightly upset and even more confused than before. This last book, this supposed culmination of a trilogy, was basically a different book altogether. I honestly felt like Divergent and Insurgent were the true beginning and end to a story, and Allegiant was fan fiction the author couldn't help but throw in.We get a completely different plot that ends up overshadowing the main plot of the first two books, our Mary Sue character apparently becomes a bit too perfect for the author to handle, and a character who is clearly emotionally unstable and extremely codependent on the main character suddenly becomes the main character himself.I adore Toby. He is like that hurt puppy you want to cuddle all day long. But we just spent two books cheering on the extremely perfect Tris. I don't mean perfect as in she can do no wrong, but I do mean that in the end she always fights for the greater good and we are all fans of the greater good. And now you're giving us the boy who spends all three books still in fear of his father, and honestly never getting over the abuse he felt growing up. He latches on to this inherently strong individual who offers him love and support in a way that no one else could. He is honestly weak, as shown throughout the the book and at the end. He doesn't give us any true character development. I'm supposed to just be okay with this because he is obviously the authors favorite character considering she gives him a voice here and some side stories? Or is she just bowing to the masses of little girl Toby-lovers and giving them what they want, which no author should ever do because it's not the fans' story to write? This is why fan fiction exists, so that creative folks don't have to worry about their work being manipulated by the audience.Ranting aside, the switch between characters was often confusing due to a lack in distinct character voices for both main characters, the ending was just random in a way that did not at all flow with the rest of the books, and everyone who is a fan could do without reading Allegiant altogether.

I liked Insurgent pretty well although I didn't understand a lot of Tris' actions, but the 3rd book just totally lost me. It started off okay with going out of the city to see what was out there but it fell apart quickly. After getting to the compound, it's like they didn't do much of anything. Inconsistent with these Dauntless adventure-seekers. And Four aligning with Nita because he's all upset about being GD was out of character. I found the dual POV confusing sometimes but didn't mind it as much as some others did, though I agree it was hard to tell them apart a lot and I don't think Four would have acted or spoken as he did. He's too much a leader for that. So many inconsistencies ... the compound was so close but it wasn't seen from the top of the Ferris Wheel or the 99th floor of the zip line building? Lights would have been seen for sure. Natalie was able to keep her communications with the compound secret? Eurudite getting the simulation serum from the compound when a war would cause just the reaction the Bureau DIDN`T want from their government overseers? Not finding another way to keep the Bureau from resetting memories in Chicago?  The whole story line was just too contrived for me, and I HATED the ending.

I now have to try and review this without giving away too many spoilers re the ending.I decided not to read Insurgent after I'd finished Divergent (I did start this series late so both books were already out when I started) as I wanted to be able to read the second and third books straight after each other - and I am so glad that I did.Allegiant starts pretty much straight after Insurgent finishes and find that Tris is still branded a traitor and being kept apart from everyone along with Christina. Eventually a small group of rebels begins to form in response to the factionless regime implemented by Evelyn. Some of these then decide to leave the city and see what lies outside the city boundaries - including Tris, Four, Uriah, Cara & Caleb (saving him from being executed). There they finally find out the history of the world and what led them to be in Chicago to begin with.Although at first it seems like the 'Bureau' are the good guys it soon emerges that they aren't any better than Jeannine Matthews or the factionless. Of course things eventually come to a head where big decisions have to be made which will affect not only their own lives but the lives of everyone.The ending of the book took me completely by surprise and seems to fly in the face of convention with series of this genre. This was an extremely brave choice made by Veronica Roth and, I would hazard a guess, not an easy one to make. Knowing that there would be a lot fans of the series who would, for want of a better word, be outraged by her decision. I'm not one them. I thought the ending was fitting with the character of Tris and the culmination of the journey that she had been on from the start of the series. It was completely in character for her to do what she did - I could see her decision coming after a conversation she had with Caleb. Finally she was able to do the right thing for the right reason which showed incredible growth on her part.I also loved the switch in point of views from Tris to Four giving the story a whole new dimension and from this we were able to see his growth as a person too. In fact, in this book we kind of see a switch in the characters with Four acting out like Tris did in Insurgent.This was an amazing finish to a great series and I cannot wait to see how the film version compares. I know there are a lot of people who won't the like ending and say that this spoiled the series for them.

You need to have read the first 2 books to understand what is going on in this one.This book was, to be honest, the hardest book of the trilogy for me to read. There's several reasons why.1 - This book is told from dual POV's, jumping between Tris and Tobias. It took me quite a while to get my head round this as I had to constantly remind myself which character I was reading about. It was, at times, very confusing.2 - Once the characters leave their home and venture outside the fence we are bombarded with a lot of information about what's actually going on. There's a lot we find out which I had to really concentrate on in order to follow.3 - The ending. I went into this knowing that the ending was something which a lot of readers didn't like. So I was anticipating it all the way through. Usually I read a book without checking reviews as I want to go into it with a fresh mind and perspective. But because this is such a well known series I couldn't avoid reviews. It did kind of spoil it for me a bit.The lives of Tris, Tobias, and their friends have yet again been turned upside down by a revelation at the end of book 2. This leads them to decide on a course of action which will take them away from the lives they know, and into the unknown.Along the way there are characters whose lives are lost, some more emotionally charged than others. But all necessary to the story in some way.Tris and Tobias soon discover that their whole lives have been a lie. What everyone was led to believe isn't true, and what they discover shocks them to the core. They have to get their heads round a whole new scenario, while also trying to deal with their growing feelings for each other.Once I got my head round the 'true' story, I really enjoyed the way the author moved on. In trying to get some semblance of normality back, Tris and Tobias have to yet again work with their friends to bring about a change which, they believe, will better their lives.This book is a rollercoaster of emotions for the characters, their friends and families, as they explore their true destinies.I totally understand why a lot of readers didn't like the ending. I get it! But as I already said, everything was necessary to the story. The author obviously had an ending in mind, and in order to get to that conclusion she had to make some tough decisions regarding characters we have grown to love while reading the trilogy. Unfortunately that conclusion has to involve some bloodshed in order to get there.All in all a great ending to an amazing series, and I'm sad to see it end.

Not because I'm mad at the author for being 'bold and edgy' with her decision (though, really, Veronica, bold and edgy this was not).

What happened to Tris was completely meaningless, and then to watch Tobias struggle with the fallout left me in tears.  I rarely cry over anything anymore, but I cried at the end of this, and NOT in a good way.

I disagree I think if anything Tris was TOO much herself. She didn't go anywhere. She said I trust myself and I have yet to be wrong.  She went from screwed up to perfect her in no time. She didn't develop she just said I was right so I am right but stayed the same in her head.Kinda irritating. Four was a big character jump after rethinking divergent over.

This review contains spoilers, but I will try not to give away anything more than most of the other reviewers do though I can't promise anything. For those who want my opinion without spoilers all I can say is only read this if you like a story that mirrors the pointlessness of some things in eyeball life, makes you think about hard choices, and holds a lot of meaning for interactions with people in our life.I hated Tris's death as much as I hated it when will died in the first book and when Fred and Lupin and Tonks died in Harry Potter, but it was also a beautiful death. I was so afraid after reading the review that it would be meaningless and there wouldn't be time to mourn, but it had so much depth to it. What made Tris such an amazing character was her how selfless she was. If she hadn't done what she did her brother would have died anyway and nothing would have changed. Her sacrifice did make all the difference, and in the army that would be the type of sacrifice that would win a Medal of Honor. It was beautiful. And so last minute because all. The Plans they made fell through, and that happens.All the interactions were life lessons about interacting with people and comping with the reality of death. People die young. Fiction stories are meant to entertain, but a lot of times they are also meant to teach a lesson. I felt that the author's way of dealing with Tris's death was beautiful. I was crying, and I have a feeling that Roth had to be crying when she wrote it. Only the pain of killing of a character you love could have been written so well in her work.I feel that character death is a very strong device and the more the reader likes the character the stronger the catharsis is. Most author's avoid killing the main chapter, but I applaud Roth for being strong enough to kill off Tris.In regards to the comments about the science, this is a dystopian sci-fi. The science doesn't have to make any sense, and often times scientists will mislabel what a gene is responsible before figuring out later that it does something else. And as to the truth serums, sci-fi is my response. You really can't bash the science in science fiction. Nobody bashes the science behind Anne McCaffrey's books because stories like that are about the people in them, not the hard science behind them.My one and only issue with this book was I had a lot of trouble telling the difference between Tobias and Tris's voices in the story and often became confused as to which character was narrating.", "reviewerName": "Francesca Huber \"Anehalia\"", "summary": "beautiful", "helpful": [1, 4], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1391731200, "reviewerID": "A3FR6GNAMHJ6RG"}

Tris dies saving the people she loved. Great, heroic,....selfless....blah blah blah. I get it (not really)....but I don't have to like it.The memory serum plan at the end was not believable. If Tris and her friends can inoculate themselves against the serum then why does everyone who actually works in the same building not have this same inoculation as a precaution? What about the rest of the government that wasn't inoculated? Wouldn't they have come in a restore order?

Tris and Four's voices weren't differentiated enough. On more than one occasion, I mixed them up and had to re-read.- I spent the first two books becoming truly invested in the city and the factions. I found them to be unique and fascinating. The majority of this book is spent outside of that world, which sucked some of the magic out of the book for me.- Then, we leave behind the principle problems from the first two books as well:  the factions versus the factionless and the killing/hunting of the divergent. Instead, we travel to \"the real world\" and get involved in totally new problems and introduce brand new characters. The old characters are biting it an alarming rate.- They ruined Four. I don't know if it was reading his point of view versus seeing him through Tris's view, but he was no longer brave and strong. He was broken and misguided.- THE ENDING!!! I don't want to spoil anything, so I will simply say the ending is needlessly depressing. In some books, they end on a note like this and it feels right. This isn't one of those times. It seems like the author just wanted to avoid a clich&eacute;d happy (well relatively) ending to be edgy. This a YA lit. It wasn't realistic in the first two books, why start now? Also, the last few chapters drag in epilogue-like quality and sadness.PROS- The relationship between Tris and Tobias feels real. They don't always agree. It isn't always magical. But they love each other, and they forgive each other their shortcomings. I believe the book says something along the lines that they choose each other every day. That's beautiful.- The idea of all the serums was interesting. Especially the memory one. A creative and thought provoking alternative to physically killing someone. Is it really merciful?

I was already unhappy with it but I forced myself to continue and finish Allegiant. Without a doubt this is the most ill conceived and poorly written book that I have ever read. And I read a LOT of books.I don't ordinarily feel compelled to write reviews unless I think a book is exceptionally good or horribly bad. I was a latecomer to Divergent and absolutely LOVED the first two volumes, but I was waiting to finish the series so I could heap praise on the author and give all three books the most glowing review that I was capable of writing. So much for THAT plan.I think that Ms Roth lost interest in the story but she was under the gun to meet a deadline.  If she missed that deadline her little kingdom would begin to crumble. Praise for the first two books came so abundantly and easily that I imagine she thought she could just breeze through this third one and be done. After all, she had the MOVIE and all it's glorious MONEY to focus on. At the last minute she realized that her writing was SO bad that the fans were going to notice. She had to do something for shock value so maybe we'd forget the horrible writing - thus the ridiculous ending.Wild horses couldn't drag me to the movie - that is IF it still gets made. What a horrible disappointment this book was!  In fact I thought it was SO BAD that I had Amazon remove it from my Kindle and give me my money back. I'm sorry now that I ever started reading the trilogy. It'll be a while before I start another series - no matter who the author is.--------------------------Initial Review:I read and loved the other books and spent what seemed like forever happily anticipating the publication of this one.  I haven't finished it yet because I just can't get into it. It doesn't even seem to be written by the same author. I suppose she's using both Tris' and Four's voices to compare and contrast their thoughts and feelings - but in doing so (in my opinion) she has lost BOTH voices.  I can't tell them apart until whichever one is currently speaking mentions something that identifies who it is.  I know their names are at the beginning of each chapter but that's so forgettable when they sound identical.Plus, the plot seems to be recycling and going nowhere fast. I've never before given up in the middle of a book but I've already been SO disappointed - and judging by some of the other reviews I can't see it getting better - that this may be the one book that I give up on.", "reviewerName": "Girl Geek", "summary": "So Bad That I Got a Refund!", "helpful": [5, 6], "overall": 1.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383004800, "reviewerID": "A211IRWCB34XN1"}

In Allegiant, while Tris wasn't a figurehead, the story, as with Mocking Jay, left the known area for a new location, rebellions happened against \"the man\", and it felt like the trilogy went from being about the female lead to being about other characters, in this case from being about Tris to being about Four.

Tobias seems to lose the most out of all of the characters as he has to find a way to live on without Tris after he has finally found someone who loves him and wants to be with him.  I also wanted to love Allegiant, but just couldn't reconcile the ending.  Yes, war is terrible and tragic, but did Allegiant have to be so tragic, too?

During crucial moments especially they were out of character.  There were two such specific moments when Four's parents went along with what was offered to them and I was shocked--\"there is no way he/she would go along with this!\"  It was unbelievable, too contrived.Revealing what was outside the fence was not dramatic enough for me.  There was no big disclosure.  The 2nd book left a cliffhanger so that there was anticipation as to what was beyond the fence and I was let down.  It was more of the same, just unsanitary and less civilized.It was written in two points of view yet they sounded monotone so often that I forgot which one I was reading...which made for a boring read.  The ending felt rushed and forced as if to get a reaction out of the reader.  I thought it was going to be an opportunity for Caleb to be redeemed and that wasn't the case.  As a result, the ending was not as purposeful as it could have been.  In a word, this conclusion made the trilogy unsatisfying.On a more positive note, here is my favorite nonsense scene: (comments made in regards to viewing screens) Uriah says \"I don't know, if they want to watch me scratch my butt or eat dinner, I feel like that says more about them than about me.\"  Tris responds laughing \"How often are you scratching your butt, exactly?\"  Cheeky.", "reviewerName": "GO", "summary": "Unimpressive", "helpful": [9, 10], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1384128000, "reviewerID": "AIAHQNMPP1TBL"}

{"reviewTime": "02 4, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "The most major difficulty I have with this story is the degree of strawman that the author has employed when characterizing scientific inquiry. She does make some allowances to have good-guy scientists, but this whole story has a set-up that reeks of the implication \"because science therefore naziism\" which is a false equivalence that I don't well abide. Further, trying to establish the outside world was an extremely weak reveal that took fully 30% of the book. It's almost like she didn't know what she was going to do when she reached the outside world. Going through the \"genetically pure,\" \"genetically damaged\" nonsense for that length of time was hard for me to swallow because I knew she was setting it up from the start to make it easily pushed over rather than actually realistic.I decided to add one additional point here that I suffered with for three books. It would be less of a sticky point with me if the author had not proven so anti-scientific and anti-intellectual. As an author, there is some free license in word choice used to name fictional things and it is a classic technique to take the name of a real thing to convey purpose to a fictional thing that does something similar. The author does this with her ubiquitous use of the word \"serum.\" The great problem here is that the author clearly never bothered to learn what serum is. Her usage of the term clearly means \"drug\" and I know it is inspired from \"serum\" applied as medicine used against disease. Unfortunately, serum is not a drug: serum is technically the watery part of blood. When you take blood and centrifuge it, the blood cells will aggregate on the bottom of the centrifugation vessel leaving only a clear fluid, the serum. Serum is the stuff that comes out when you burst a blister. Serum can in some cases be used as a treatment for a disease: if an animal or a person has raised an immunity to some antigen, a toxin, a protein poison or sometimes a virus, they have antibodies in their blood that can recognize this antigen. If you collect the serum containing these antibodies, you can administer it to a victim of the disease and sometimes cure them or save their lives. A particularly effective application is against snake bites. If you treat an animal like a goat with low levels of snake bite toxin, they build up a resistance to it by raising antibodies against it in their blood. When a person is bitten by a snake, you administer serum to them collected from the goat... the goat's serum antibodies then operate with the snake bite victim's own immune system to clear the snake toxin from that person's body, lessening the effect of the bite. Hopefully, anybody reading this will stop to wonder why a death spray would ever come out of a serum obtained from a living creature. Does the author simply have an aversion to the word \"poison\" or is she incapable of using words for what they mean?

{"reviewTime": "05 21, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Divergent is one of my favorite series, and I was so excited to see how it would end! I was a little worried I wasn't going to love Allegiant as much as Divergent and Insurgent, though, because a lot of people seemed to be disappointed with the way Veronica Roth ended the series. I loved it, though, and Divergent continues to be one of my favorite series!Instead of having only Tris's narration like in Divergent and Insurgent, Allegiant has dual POVs from Tris's and Four's perspectives. Even though I love Four, I wasn't to keen on that decision at first - partly because I'm always iffy about changing something like that within a series, and partly because to me, the two voices just sounded a little bit too similar. After a while, though, I got used to the dual narrative and started to enjoy getting Four's perspective on things, and I saw how this set-up makes sense with the structure of the story.My favorite part of Allegiant was definitely the development of the characters - many of the characters we got to know in the first two books undergo a learning process and experience a lot of character growth in the last book of the series. The relationships develop in interesting and at least partly surprising ways, too; I especially enjoyed following the relationship between Tris and Caleb because I thought the brother/sister relationship didn't get enough spotlight in the first two books. Both Tris's and Four's development is interesting in relation to the factions and their values as well as the plot of Allegiant: there's no right or wrong, not even one bad guy, really, just lots of different and conflicting ideologies.What fell short, though, in comparison to the character development, is the worldbuilding. I was really excited to see what had happened to the rest of the world, but sadly, we don't get that much information. I feel like there was just too much stuff that the characters don't find out about until this book, making Allegiant crammed with information and conflicts that I had a hard time distinguishing and focusing on. We don't get to see one issue be explored in any depth, and I'm still not entirely sure what the rest of the world looks like, because we are always only told and not shown about what the world has come to. To me, it might have been better to break with the trilogy format and split this up into two books so that we could explore this world's issues better, even though of course I know a lot of other factors play into decisions like thatI know a lot of people were upset about the ending, but I for one loved it. I can see why people are upset - and of course I was upset too; I was bawling for the last 50 pages. It's really unconventional, but I think this ending works really well with the development of the plot and the characters.I can see where others' complaints about Allegiant are coming from because I'll admit that the ending is upsetting and the worldbuilding isn't as strong in this book as in the previous two. I still really enjoyed it, though, because the great character growth and emotions the story evoked in me made up for it.

{"reviewTime": "05 15, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Tris and Four were shocked to see the damning video left by one of Tris' ancestors. Now the city of Chicago is in chaos since Four's mother seized power. The Factionless are in charge and the former Factions are forcibly disbanded. The city is on the verge of another war. Tris is approached by the members of the secret group known as The Allegiant. The Allegiant want to maintain the factions while sending the Divergent outside as dictated by the city's founders. So now Tris, Four and few others will journey beyond the city confines to see what is on the other side. Will they find chaos and ruin or something far more troubling?What I Liked:*This one of the hardest reviews for me to write. I went into this book with great trepidation after months of avoiding it. So many people told me that didn't like this final installment, and I was wary as I know full well how it feels to disappointed by the final installment of a beloved series. Needless to say, my fears were unwarranted as I was completely blown away and stunned by the finale. Sure I can see why readers might be unhappy, but for me it was a realistic, heart wrenching, but believable ending to an amazing series. I loved it, and I can honestly say that this is a series that will remain on my favorite shelf. It is hard to put into words my feelings without spoilers, so I will keep this spoiler free.*The world building continues to be outstanding. I did have some quibbles after Insurgent, but Ms. Roth got back on track in this final book as she presented some stunning revelations regarding the factions and the world outside the city confines. I loved the surprise! Well done, Ms. Roth. Her ideas are terrific, and I liked how she brought the whole nature vs. nurture issue to a whole other level. I won't get into the details here, but let's just say she brings up a debate regarding pure genes vs. damaged genes and shows what happens when society tries to pin evil behavior on bad genes. Can one so easily separate behavior from genetics? I think not, and I loved seeing how Ms. Roth wove this debate into her story.*Tris and Four continue to grow and mature and change in unexpected ways. For the first time in the series, the reader gets Four's view point. It was interesting to peek beneath his tough guy facade and see the real Tobias underneath. He is frightened and insecure and still trying to break free of the abused child he once was. He flounders quite a bit in this final book before finding his footing, and it was hard to see the fierce Four reduced to a man struggling with his identity and his past. Tris, on the other hand, continues to grow and mature in new, positive directions. While she may be a Dauntless, she hasn't forgotten her Abnegation lifestyle, and her past leads her to make some tough choices that lead to a heart wrenching choice. I liked seeing her selfless side, especially at the end regarding Caleb. She shows maturity beyond her years, and I was most pleased with her growth.*The romance..... I struggled again with the romance in this book. I wanted to return to the breathless giddiness that I felt in Divergent. Tris and Four's blooming relationship in the first book remains the highlight of the series for me. Since that first book, the romance has gone through the all too familiar stumbling blocks. I hated seeing the dramatic downturn in this book, but in the end, I was pleased with the final outcome. It ends up strong again, but nothing like the swoon worthy romance I fell in love with. Even though I had issues with the romance, it is true to life. We all want to stay in those giddy highs we experience when falling in love and ignore the realities of building a relationship. So even though I missed the giddiness, I appreciated that Ms. Roth walked us through the growing pains.*The ending..... I won't go into spoilers here, but I personally thought the series ended realistically and satisfactory. Yes, there are several painful sacrifices and plenty of heartbreak on the way to the end. Fans cried out because they didn't get their perfect happily ever after, but you know what? That is life, we don't always get rainbows and sunshine. Ms. Roth delivers an ending that made sense as it stayed true to the characters. I don't think it could have gone any other way. Tris could never live with the guilt of asking someone else to sacrifice. I appreciated that Ms. Roth made some tough choices, and in the end, she gives us an ending with hope. I was even pleased with the Epilogue, I thought it wrapped up the book nicely. I couldn't have asked for more.*I listened to the audiobook version of this book and I was pleased with both the narrators for Tris and Four. I had no issues with the audio and would definitely recommend the audiobook, though this is a book that I feel I need to go back and read to fully absorb the information.And The Not So Much:*I wish that I had a better grip on the whole Factionless population. Early on in the series, it was indicated that they were nothing more than homeless refugees, but in reality there was so much more to the story. As much time as Ms. Roth spent on developing the Factions, she should have devoted the same amount of time to the Factionless as they ended up playing and important role in the book.*Once Tris, Four and the others venture outside the city, I was excited to learn all the secrets, but then I quickly grew bored as they were once again drawn into more of the same conflicts. It was a bit boring to have the story reduced to more of the same as it takes on genetically pure vs. genetically damaged instead of the Factions.*There is a heavy focus on Four's father, Marcus, throughout the series. He once again plays an important role in this book. I was dissatisfied that nothing is resolved with him. I wanted Four to stand up and confront him, and at the very least see him become accountable for his actions, but nothing really happens to him. I was expecting something more from this storyline after all the buildup.*I was hoping for a bit more redemption as far as Caleb was concerned. I was happy that things took a more positive turn with him, but I still wanted more.Allegiant delivers a stunning finale to an exciting, entertaining and highly original series. I felt the ending was realistic and I was left satisfied. This final chapter doesn't quite deliver the happily ever after that readers hope for, but it stays true to the characters and the story. I loved the intelligent ideas presented, and I will be pondering on this one for weeks to come. If you have yet to check out this smart series, do so. I loved it and I can say I will definitely be revisiting it.I borrowed a copy of this book.

I have bookish friends to do that with! Still, like many other readers I devoured the book on release day. I've seen a variety of different reactions and thought I'd add mine. I won't be giving away plot points but I will certainly be talking about how it made me feel. If you don't want to know anything at all you should probably stop reading right now. Also, don't go to any blog posts about the book. Actually, you should probably just get off the internet because it is littered with major spoilers!!! :)So, day two post finishing Allegiant... and I'm still all wrapped up about it. First and foremost, I think it's amazing. Veronica Roth can sure tell a story. I admire her and the choices she made in writing the story as she did. And I think it's just... right. I can't think of any other word to use.That doesn't mean I wasn't sitting slack-jawed at parts or that my heart didn't break at others. Sure, there are things I wish didn't have to happen. But I don't wish it because they are &#34;wrong&#34; or ruin the story or because I think Veronica Roth &#34;owed&#34; me or anything like that. I wish it because they are hard and sad and I wish they weren't so true to what would likely happen. I wish everyone, everywhere got a happily ever after. I wish a broken world could easily be healed. I wish many, many, things. But as John Green writes in The Fault in our Stars, &#34;The world is not a wish-granting factory.&#34; So, yes, things happened that shocked and upset me. But they certainly didn't ruin the book.

I didn&#8217;t feel for a single person at any time.Tris and Four&#8217;s relationship? They are a HORRIFIC couple.

I'd constantly have to flip to the front of the chapters to see who was speaking.The plot was utterly ridiculous. Roth set up a world with factions, Choosing Day, power balances, etc., only to completely abandon it and instead make it out to be a sham. The justification for this is that the U.S. government, (which is still a thing in this book; a bit incongruous, huh?) created the propaganda of certain people being &#8220;genetically damaged&#8221;, so cities such as Tris&#8217;s were designed to rectify this.

I loved the Divergent books.  I read all three of them within a couple of days... it really is a good thing I was done with my semester at school, or else nothing would have gotten done!  However, out of the three, this was my least favorite - and not because of the reasons that most hate the book.I don't hate the book.  I just think that there was so much that was just different about it, that it didn't make is as good as the other two.Let me put it out there before I even start: I LOVED the ending of this book.  I know most people hate it, but I did not.  I thought it was how the ended needed to be.  If it would have been a different ending, I don't think I would have liked the book as much as I did.Now, let's delve into the few issues I did have with this book.  First, the plot.  I liked where the plot went in this book.  It was very interesting.  However, what I didn't like was that suddenly we are switching chapters between Tris and Four's point of views.  While I see why it was necessary because of how the book went, I still didn't like it.  I was almost glad I was warned of that before I started reading the book or else I would have gotten really confused at the beginning.The second thing that really annoyed me about this book was Tris and Four's relationship.  I felt like after two books they should have been more trusting and just solid in their relationship, but yet again in this book there is more trust issues and problems, and I found it frustrating.  I know others didn't, but that is one thing that really annoyed me while reading.However, other than those two knit picky things, I really enjoyed this book.  Be prepared and have Kleenex on hand while reading (learned this one the hard way), but it really is how I think the ending of the series should have been.  If you started the series, read this one! I know a lot of people that have heard things about it and so they have just decided to not read it.  I totally disagree.  This book puts a whole different spin on the world Roth set up in Divergent, and I was fascinated with it.Overall: Great ending to a great series.

I will thetefore attempt to sum up my critique briefly and without spoilers.1) I loved the first 2 books, this one under delivers, and feels like it shouldn't even be part of the series. The author just abandons major story lines and has them occur off page, then throws new plot lines at us that we don't care about and in which we have not invested 2 books.2) I will willingly suspend my disbelief to fall into a new world/mythology. However, the &#34;answers&#34; provided in this conclusion volume were lazy and stupid. Just because you made up the world doesn't mean you can throw whatever completely implausible reasoning at your readers and have us accept it as part of the universe. For example, you could tell me that a nuclear war made the planet uninhabitable, so we had to go to space. You don't get to say, we're in space, therefore everything you know of human nature has completely changed because... ummmm... because... I say so.3) The writing was poor. I have slightly lower standards for YA writing, but we've seen great examples of the form in recent years. Even the first two books were great stories. This is not that. The author's decision to use dual first person narratives was inorganic and poorly differentiated. I couldn't tell when Tris was talking or when it was Tobias because they have the exact same voice.4) The characters behaved in uncharacteristic ways so that the author could manufacture situations that otherwise made no sense. Again, inorganic and lazy.Basically, I wish I'd never begun reading the series because the final installment is so disappointing, I feel like I wasted my time in the first two books (which I enjoyed) because now I know the last part of the story is silly and poorly done.

{"reviewTime": "11 14, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Divergent was refreshing. I enjoyed the unique premise, the lack of a love triangle, and a female lead character that was neither a pushover nor brilliant at everything. After the slightly less satisfying Insurgent (which I expected of a middle book), I was excited to read Allegiant and bring the series to a close.Unfortunately, it is a dissatisfying ending (and not only because of the actual ending!) Part of what made Divergent so engrossing was its characters, but the personalities were sorely lacking in this book. At times it felt like they weren't even the same characters anymore, and I don't mean that in a growth kind of way. Four, in particular, is disappointing in this book. Though he has a sensitive side and questions it himself, no one could doubt that Four belonged in Dauntless during Divergent. Here, he has been replaced by a rash, self-doubting, moping boy I wanted to shake by the shoulders for most of the book. Tris seems more self-righteous teenager than justified insurgent, and most other characters are just filler.The action and intrigue weren't at the same level of Divergent or Insurgent, and answers to mysteries fall flat. I was left with an &#34;Oh, that's it?&#34; feeling instead of the, &#34;Wow!

Having read it last night, I am glad that I finally decided to stop paying attention to the reviews and judge for myself.  I will say that the first two titles in the series are, in general, better books, but Allegiant was certainly not terrible, nor a disappointment.  I'm not going to go into plot details here, because I really think people should judge this one for themselves.  The alternating points of view from Tris and Four was a bit confusing at times because there was not enough differentiation between the tone of the two characters to always be able to tell who was speaking, but that certainly did not make the book unreadable.  To say that I enjoyed the book would be a little dishonest, as there is little enjoyable material in this part of the story, but I am glad that I read it,  and I think fans of the series will benefit from finishing it.  After all, fans of a series cannot expect all the conflict in the story to be happily resolved and neatly wrapped up at the end.

I feel like it came out of the blue and did nothing to help the story line at all. I almost feel like it was created because there is a movie coming out, and it would make a great scene for the 3rd movie ( Although this book would need a lot of work to make it a script, unlike the other 2 books) It was torture to get through this and I am glad it is over.

Hmm let me see 2 1/2 years seems like a great place to give people updates about folks, lets write about that.I truly did love the characters in this series. They were well thought out and had layers. I also enjoyed that family played a big role in the decisions that were made as well.

It was the weakest & most RIDICULOUS idea i think I've ever read... I don't know what Roth was thinking, well, obviously, she WASNT. After all of the buildup, all of the journey through Divergent & Insurgent, we get THIS with Allegiant.I'll go out on a limb here & say that the plot driving Allegiant is weak & (I don't think I'm alone here in saying this) stupid. It's almost as if Roth was too busy counting money to care about the content of Allegiant. I thought maybe I was judging harshly so I've waited a few days after reading Allegiant to post a review....And I still think it sucks.....---possible spoilers---To start, we are reunited with Tris & Tobias at the start of a factionless regime headed by Tobias mother, Evelyn. Tris is still hated/feared/admired/respected/whatever....Can I say I HATED Tris? Always have...simply because of how Roth wrote her...Tris comes from a subservient faction to a dominant one, gets a tattoo & SUDDENLY she's the most bad ass thing this side of creation? No one can take her on? Her tail is unkickable??? Sorry, I couldn't suspend my disbelief that far...I found her extremely unlikeable, her cocksure arrogant attitude turned me off completely. Tris only gets worse in Allegiant.And Tobias? Oh where did the strong & daring Tobias of past books go? He wasn't here that's for sure. This time around Tobias acted more like a proper whipped boy than a headstrong, sure headed male. I grew tired of him falling all over himself to follow Tris.Roth wrote Allegiant with different POVs, from Tris & Tobias & it got to the point that I'd have to go back to the start of the chapter to recall WHO was talking in the 1 I was reading. Tris & Tobias were both written the same, with Tobias having exactly the same tone as Tris, the tone/attitude of a 16 year old girl.BIG SPOILER!!!!!Genetic damage? THATS WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT? That was the BEST you could do? For shame....Back to the POV chapters....I understand WHY Roth needed to have corresponding POVs by the end, the ending NEEDED that.

I wont spoil it, but let's just say that things don't turn out as expected, as one makes a sacrifice for their loved ones and another gains a family. Tris, Four and their friends finally venture outside the city limits and learn that everything that they've thought important up to that point has been part of an experiment, and that nothing is real. Everything they once believed is turned upside down, and they once again have to fight to do the right thing, which will have an everlasting effect on their entire world and culture. Packed full of adventure, and drama this book felt more serious than the first two, because it felt like we as the readers were finally getting to the true bottom of the truth, and not all these smokescreens. In this book, the author derails from the previous format and tells the story from both Tris and Fours point of views. Once you get to the end of the book, you'll understand the importance of doing this. I listened to this book in audio format, and it took me a while to get used to the actor who was reading for Four, but got used to it about half way through. Really recommend this book for parents to read with their kids (under 14) as some of the content may be too mature. However it is suitable for tweens and older.SPOILER ALERTSo I've read a lot of the negative comments that people have written about this book, in that they felt betrayed, etc. But come on people, just because Tris dies in the end and does not have her happily ever after does not mean her sacrifice is in vain. If you even think that her brother Caleb could have pulled off a successful mission at the end and taken the bullet, then you are delusional. In reality, Tris was the only one that would have been able to do it. No one else. She did not just do it for Caleb, but did it for everyone. Although I agree that Four got a bit annoying and whiny, and I didn't really understand his motivation for feeling worthless, I could still appreciated that he was struggling dealing with the fact that everything he once believed in was a lie. I think the author did a good job of putting hints throughout the entire series, that there was more going on here than just your normal city left to survive. It was not that big of a leap to imagine that this was an experimental city. I thought this book ended the way it needed to.

Yes, it still felt a little tedious and slow like the second book, but this one wraps everything up. It leaves no questions unanswered, and Insurgent really makes sense now with Allegiant read. Her physiological and gene emphasis definitely makes her series unique in dystopian fiction. What makes it even more amazing is that these are her first books!

In fact, I must say the best part of the book was the end and the death. The death represents so much--the character's original faction and her adopted one; her journey; forgiveness; victory over fear; and I could go on. Her death is really beautiful and that is why I gave the book a four because the ending was so gut wrenching, but heartwarming. After that moment, events and characters really come full circle.

I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other, I choose him over and over again... and he chooses me.&#8221;That sweet little piece from Allegiant is probably the only thing I found to my liking when I read this book. I&#8217;ve been procrastinating about writing a review for this because I thought maybe I&#8217;d change my mind about how I feel. Meh! It only made me more disappointed than I already was.I have been tense throughout reading this. Aside from the constant angry comments and text messages I&#8217;ve been receiving from Maria @ Reading is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac (we were buddy reading), there was this gut feeling that all of this was going to end bad.I like Tris here, she&#8217;s the brave girl I once saw in Divergent and not the annoying b*tch she has become in Insurgent. I love the moments with Tobias; his sweetness and selflessness, and all the gushy moments with Tris. Too bad I couldn&#8217;t find it in me to savour them. He suddenly turns into someone I don&#8217;t even recognize. He used to be a consistent character during the previous books and then I see him with so much negativity. This is not the Four I used to know. Is this a plot to make Tris a more endearing character that would make her sacrifice a lot more dramatic and justified? It didn&#8217;t work, just so you know.It took me quite a while to absorb everything. At first, I felt so detached from the story. I don&#8217;t know if maybe I&#8217;m looking at Allegiant with fresh eyes or lost ones. I had issues with almost every decision the characters made. I should mention, by the way, that I really had problems with the amount of characters in this book &#8211; it&#8217;s a struggle to keep up.In the end, to be honest, I just felt cheated. I read Divergent with such optimism, and when I finished Insurgent, even though I didn&#8217;t find it as grand as Divergent, I felt there was something rather deep going on with this trilogy. Allegiant just made me realize that reading Insurgent was a complete waste of time. It felt pointless. And Allegiant itself was shallow and overrated.It was a truly tragic ending. It was sad and heartbreaking. I expected to be pissed but I&#8217;m not as angry as I thought I would be. But it did leave me questioning; was it a necessary kind of sacrifice to make?

{"reviewTime": "01 5, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "The first part of this review will be spoiler-free, as best as I can make it.I read both Divergent and Insurgent, and while I was not impressed, they weren't bad and I was interested enough to see the series through. I was mostly interested in seeing the whys and hows of the world.Unfortunately, it was very disappointing in execution.The book opens almost immediately after the end of Insurgent. The dual narrative of Tris and Tobias was, simply, not pulled off. The voices of both characters sounded exactly alike--multiple times throughout the book, I would think I was reading from Tris's POV, and then suddenly realize that it was actually Tobias. It made for a very distracting reading experience. And what happened to Tobias himself? He was a strong character in the first two books, but in Allegiant he has suddenly become whiny and easily upset. Tris also seems to be right about almost everything, which was grating.The romance between those two was....awkward? There were several major kissing scenes, and while they never really got fresh, they happened too frequently and I got really tired of constantly reading how Tobias smelled like wind.As for the world reveal, that was where I had my biggest problems with the book. Apparently it is very easy to leave and enter Chicago, despite what we've learned from the previous two books, and the characters come back and forth pretty often. If it was so easy, why did no one try it before? It didn't quite make sense.When the characters leave Chicago, and come to a place called the Bureau, this is where they learn about the world. It all comes in an info-dump. We get paragraphs of how and why Chicago was sectioned off and the factions were created. It wasn't very plausible; the reasoning behind the factions felt sketchy and a little hard to believe. The characters were also well-received at the Bureau, which I thought felt strange. These people just show up, wanting to know more about their world, and they are taken in and treated well and given answers to their questions....I didn't like it. It was too easy. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's hard to clearly describe what went wrong without doing so.The resolution to the war between the factions was very, very anti-climatic, and very, very disappointing. It was far too easy, like Roth wanted to wrap it up quickly. The use of the serums has become a deus ex machina: they seem like easy cop-outs, at least in this book. And the concept of sacrifice and other themes was presented a little too preachily.........which leads me to the ill-received ending. My problem with the ending wasn't with the result itself, but the circumstances leading to and after it. Roth had had this planned from the beginning, and it almost felt like she was forcing the story to fit this plan. The characters get sloppy with their planning--coming up with a suicide mission when they obviously could have done better. There was no true reason for the ending, the way it was written. There was no true purpose. That was what I didn't like about it.In the end, I think Allegiant was the weakest of the three. It definitely felt its 500+ pages, and not in a good way. I didn't actually hate it, but it definitely fell short of what I was hoping it could be.And now, big spoilers will follow so I can explain in clearer detail on the ending and the world reveal.*****************SPOILERS*********If the main character is going to die, there preferably should be a reason, no other options available. With Tris, there were other options that could have been taken. As it happened, she survives death serum, only to be shot. Though she died, it would have made no difference to the story if she had lived. She didn't have to die. There was no reason for her to, the way it was presented. If the death serum had killed her, that would have been better. Or if they absolutely had NO other plan, and something would become of the death. But they could have done better, and nothing ever came from the death. It felt forced, like Roth wanted to make a point about sacrifice. It just didn't work.And the world reveal....I didn't buy the whole genetics scenario. Centuries ago, the government decided that they would remove genes that caused \"bad\" behavior (like selfishness, lying, etc, all of the things the factions stood against). Well, the removal of those genes turned out to make another bad trait stand out, and so the altered people, the \"genetically damaged,\" and the unaltered people, the \"genetically pure,\" got into a war. To resolve it, the government put all of the \"genetically damaged\" people into controlled places (like the factions in Chicago) to allow them to eventually \"breed out,\" so to speak, the \"damaged\" genes and become \"pure\" again. The genetically \"pure\" people are the Divergents.

That being said, the book wasn't necessarily bad and I feel that most fans of the series will ultimately be at least satisfied with the trilogy's ending. (In other words, it could have been a lot worse.) There's not much I can say about the story without giving too much away; the action and intrigue that comprised the first two books is still present in Allegiant. Also present is the ensuing romance between Tris and Tobias. Despite having the core elements that made up the first two books, there were a few things that I took issue with in Allegiant...For one, this book is told from the perspectives of both Tris AND Tobias. I was initially very excited about this aspect of the book. However, I just feel that this idea was better in theory. The dual perspective was not executed very well. There was no real distinction between the voices of Tris and Tobias. If you were to open to a random page and read it you would not be able to distinguish who was speaking (except for use of pronouns, names, etc.). I feel that Roth should have spent more time developing a clear voice for Tobias instead of using the same writing style she's used for Tris's voice.I was also a little disappointed about what was &#34;beyond the fence.&#34; Don't get me wrong, it was interesting and thought-provoking, but... I just expected more! I feel like the explanation for the secrets behind Tris's world were just very bland (for lack of a better word). The previous two books were just so mind-blowing that I expected the same sort of pizzaz from Allegiant, but it just wasn't there.Despite these errors, Allegiant really is a decent ending to the trilogy.

She then also showed her strength and bravery by dieing  for what she believed in and facing it head on!

{"reviewTime": "11 11, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Allegiant, you were the biggest disappointment of the year for me. Here I was looking for an epic battle between the Allegiant and the Erudite but instead, what I got was a complete and utter mess. It's taken me days to form some coherent thoughts on the book so here goes...WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADThe problems I had with AllegiantMY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIENow I don't have any problems with going out of the box, and Allegiant was a true mind numbing experience. Instead of giving us the epic, final battle we were looking for, Veronica Roth chose to defer from the whole thing and explain the true reasoning behind the factions. This is how it went...The Bureau of Genetic Warfare: You were all an experiment, and your whole life and everything you know is a lie.Tris and co.: ...Oh okay then.Wouldn't you think that if this happened to you and your friends, there would be denial, breakdowns, refusals and drama? These guys were just stunned, accepting mullets.WHAT MAKES YOU SO PERFECTThe biggest shock to Tris and Co. appear to be some strange form of prejudice, where the Bureau has manufactured the Chicago experiment to box people away into their neat little pigeon holes so they can modify their behaviour based on their genetically damaged (GD) genes. Yes, these are the factions that we know.The reasoning behind this is to absolve the flawed behaviour of these genetically damaged people after the government has unsuccessfully messed around with people's genes resulting in The Purity War, which I'll talk more about below.I don't know about you, but calling someone genetically damaged does not sit right with me. Everyone has flaws and you learn to live together and love one another. If you thought the prejudice of the factions were bad, imagine the disdain that would come from someone's genetic makeup. I can't ever imagine people giving consent to messing with people's genes on a mass scale...Every faction loses something when it gains a virtue: the Dauntless, brave but cruel; the Erudite, intelligent but vain, the Amity, peaceful but passive; the Candor, honest but inconsiderate; the Abnegation, selfless but stifling.FLAWED REASONINGThe Bureau pretty much manufactured the experiments after The Purity War, where those with damaged genes after extensive genetic manipulation had waged a war on the government and those with pure genes. Their primary goal is to ultimately heal people's genes to become the Divergent, recovering from the ultimate fatal flaws of the GD. If this is the case, why did they not equip the Chicago experiment with this knowledge and filter all of the Divergent out of the city, once identified? Why were the Divergent placed under threat from the faction leaders? It makes no sense.LET'S JUST HIT RESETThose Bureau guys just won't learn. It appears that the uprising in Chicago has happened once before in the outer edges of the factionless places. So they administered the memory serum to make everyone forget it ever happened and start over. While it's happening again, and what's their solution? The memory serum again. Just so they can watch their sick reality TV show all over again.Not to mention Tris's plan to wipe the memories of The Bureau, thereby making everything obsolete and pointless. The experiments, the GD war, the serums, everything. Let's stop them from wiping away the memories of our loved ones by wiping away their memories, that will teach them! Last I heard, two wrongs don't make a right.GOODBYE SEXY BROODY FOUR, HELLO MR WHINYWhen Allegiant was announced, we were excited to get inside the mind of the mysterious Four and find out what goes on in his head. What it turns out to be is a constant whining, insecurity, mommy and daddy issues, and a whole lot of angsty emotion. Four in Divergent/Insurgent, was a hunky, confident, mysterious instructor. Four in Allegiant is an annoying, whingy puddly mess. Not only that, but in Allegiant he seems to make all the wrong decisions and not trust Tris repeatedly, even though she was right. Roth must have had a vendetta against him, making his decisions result in Uriah's death, taking away Tris, making him one of the GD.As the book switched perspectives between Tris and Four, it was difficult to pick out who it was throughout the book. The two just sounded so damn similar and their voice was exactly the same.SIDE CHARACTERS - WHO WERE THEY AGAIN?Christina, Uriah, Caleb, Cara and co. were all in this book but the fact of the matter is - you could have taken them away and come up with exactly the same outcome. The only one that seemed to make any impact was Nita, the new rebel girl who has her own illogical ideas. But the whole flirting with disaster thing with Four? Didn't sit well with me. And Caleb of course, who was a sniveling mess of a man living in the shadow of what he did to Tris in the past. There's a man who for his whole early life, urged Tris to be selfless. There's a man who couldn't be selfless himself, when it came down to it.HERE'S AN IDEA - LET'S COMMUNICATE!At the end of the book, there's 4 different plans that went on to stop the overthrowing of the Chicago experiment, that would result in the death of thousands and dare I say - the genetically pure/Divergent. The Bureau would release a mass memory serum and wipe out the memories of the entire city. One group will go in to inoculate their loved ones from the mass memory wipe. The other group will go in, take the death serum and release the memory serum on The Bureau. And Four decides to go against all of this and administer the memory serum to either Evelyn or Marcus to end this thing once and for all. At any one point, they could have told each other what was going on. But nope, never happened. Which is frustrating, seeing as Four's plan could have saved them all.FINALLY...THE DEATH WAS ONLY FOR SYMBOLISM'S SAKEI'm not so cut that Tris died in the first place, after all that is who Tris is, brave and selfless and always putting her loved ones ahead of herself, even if it was for snivelling Caleb who deserves death himself. Tris, in this novel could do no wrong. She was always right, she was selfless, she was genetically pure, she loved and finally sacrificed herself for the good of everyone. That's great, because we love Tris and her journey over the past 3 books have showed her that she's her own person.But my biggest problem was how the author administered the final blow, and then the way she justified it to everyone in her explanatory blog post. Let's have Tris survive a death serum (how is that even possible), have a false sense of survival and then have someone come in a shoot her! That is just cruel. Tris has survived death so many times and she went in because she knew she had a sliver of a chance in surviving. Roth considered having her survive, but didn't, just because she deserved it and that was what she chose:This was the end she had chosen, and I felt she had earned an ending that was as powerful as she was. - RothSymbolism's sake, the ending could have just been powerful in the wake of Tris surviving, but instead it is causing an Erudite/Factionless outrage.OVERALL THOUGHTSI found Allegiant to be disappointing for a myriad of reasons, it was illogical, rendered a book boyfriend completely useless and ripped away what could have been a satisfying ending to an awesome trilogy into something that completely ruined my affinity for the whole series. Veronica Roth took risks, she's Dauntless and gave us something that we couldn't have imagined and that, I do respect. Unfortunately, the end result turned out to be an incoherent mess filled with illogical sequences and a crappy ending.Now does anyone know where I can get myself some memory serum?I received a review copy from Harper Collins Australia in exchange for an honest review.

She could have killed his mother, after reconciling by his father.

Gone is the vivid dystopian society that Roth spent so much time establishing .  Tris seems almost unrecognizable and even worse - thanks to Roth's apparently inability to write characters with distinc voices - Four has turned into the male equivalent of Tris.

{"reviewTime": "04 3, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Before I spoil this book for you I will give you a chance to decide before going into details. Allegiant was different from book 1&2. It really goes into genetics more than fighting and stuff like the other books. If you would like to finish this story I recommend reading this book up to chapter 49 and starting chapter 49 online with the alternate ending. you can Google it, a couple of fans have written a more appeasing alternate ending. That is what I would do to finish this trilogy. But if you go passed chapter 49 you are in for a twist. Okay that was your chance now for the SPOILER ALERT. BOOK REVIEW:The divergent trilogy was conflicting to review. DIVERGENT (book1) and INSURGENT (book2) were amazing! I literally read both books multiple times because it was so good. However, Veronica Roth, in the third book broke my heart in a million pieces. The way the stories are written from the very beginning (book1-book3) is very misleading. She deluded the readers into thinking and buying into what seemed like possible \"foreshadowing\" as to how this story might end and then she does not meet those expectations. THIS IS THE SPOILER. Tris at the end of DIVERGENT learns that Jeanine Matthews has given Four a newly developed simulation serum which makes his surroundings appear threatening to him and he can no longer see Tris as Tris ''his love interest'' but as his enemy. Tris can't get through to him. At this point he cannot hear or see her as anything other than a threat. Tris and Four fight to the point where she draws a gun to him. She decides that nothing is worth killing him for and so she turns the gun around to her own head as she had done in her own fear of landscape when she volunteered to die instead of killing the people she loved. She is ready to die for this. This act pulls Four out of the simulation and he is back to reality.Then in INSURGENT Tris, Four, and others, temporarily reside in Amity, then with the factionless, and eventually end up in Candor. Tris by now had been reckless with her life; Working against Four by conspiring with Marcus (Four's abusive father), shooting herself in a simulation, but most importantly, going to Erudite headquarters willingly giving her life to Jeanine Matthews in order to save the other divergent from dying. She was ready to die.  At the end of the book Tori ends up killing Jeanine Matthews and Four finds out that Tris was working against him but there is a bigger truth that keeps him from being upset with her.In ALLEGIANT they have discovered that there is a world behind the fence.Their is mix group of Amities, Erudite, Candor, Dauntles who call themselves the ALLEGIANT. They decide that they need to explore what is behind the fence. Some go and some stay behind. Tris, Four, Peter, Caleb, Christina, Uriah, Cara, all make it beyond the fence and they find out the truth. The truth is that they were part of an experiment that started generations back and the people running the experiment are interested in the divergent because those who aren't divergent are genetically damaged and they believe that is the cause of so many crimes among human beings. What these group of people intend to do is release a serum that wipe away the memory of all the people left in the experiment who include Four's parents, Uriah's family, Christina's family and all the people that they all grew up knowing. Wiping away their memories would be like they never existed. All they would know is their names and how to read and write but Tris and the rest decide that is not enough. Tris and Four want to stop this but the only way to do that is to go into a lab room that is enclosed with a pass code that only one person knows. That person is the one interested in wiping the memories of the people left in the experiment. So they can't count on his help. There is a death serum that is released into the air If anyone was to break into this room. So ultimately someone has to sacrifice their lives to retrieve the memory serum and prevent them of sending it out and instead Tris wants to give it the the people running the experiment so that both worlds can exist. In Allegiant Tris realizes that she does not want to die. She wants to live and Four foreshadows or hint towards having a life with Tris after all this is done. Tris through out this particular book expresses her desire to live and her love for Four and admits that Four and she have a complex relationship but she will rather weather the storm and choose to be with him everyday of her life just as her parents chose each other every time. Veronica  Roth deluded the readers into buying into those foreshadowing moments for example in Insurgent Tris cries into Four's arms saying that she's lost her entire family to death or betrayal and Four says that he is her family now. There were many more misleading moments like this one where Veronica Roth makes you picture a life after this struggle where Tris and Four find a world that works and they are there for each other always. It is so misleading that when they decide that someone has to sacrifice their life for this cause, Caleb volunteers to do so and Caleb has no lose ends. He betrayed Tris by working with Jeanine Matthews and letting Jeanine almost kill Tris. Caleb's parents are both dead. There is nothing left for him in the story, no friends, no family, no love interest, there would have been no lose ends with him dying. At the last minute Tris takes his place and goes in for serum which by the way did not kill her but upon leaving the room she encounters David, the guy running the experiment and he shoots her to her death. Mind you the story was set up for her to live. It was heart wrenching and a very poor decision to kill her character off. Veronica Roth should have kept the story going toward her self sacrifice motto in Allegiant if she was going to kill Tris anyway. But she didn't. Instead she diverted the plot and Tris' concept of life to where it all made sense for Tris to live along side Four who never felt loved or like he was worth loving until Tris. She tells him that he is and that she loves him. It all fit to end with them both alive. If anything I could've seen a plot twist where Four falls under the memory serum on his way to the others and he loses all knowledge of Tris and what she has done and how he feels for her and Tris has to fight for him to recover his memories of her and make him fall in love with her all over again or something like that. Instead Veronica Roth chose to kill Tris and Four comes back to the news of her death. It was a devastating ending.We as readers become engaged in their lives. We become emotionally invested in these stories. We follow these characters books upon books investing our time and developing a vulnerability towards them and I feel like Veronica Roth in this particular book really let me down. I would recommend reading book 1 and book 2 (Divergent, Insurgent) and ending the story there. Knowing that there is something more to this world than what divergent describes and making up the ending for yourself or reading an alternate ending online (there are a couple written by costumers). Or if not then don't even start the trilogy unless you're ready for a heartbreak.", "reviewerName": "Jennifer garcia", "summary": "spoiler alert!

I guess that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve never read a book that can be so true to life. In real life happy endings don&#8217;t always exist and life is not always fair. We see this every day in our lives yet we rarely see this in books. And truthfully, I did love this book. I loved this book all the way until the end. The end is NOT what I wanted and I was so upset that I wanted to rate this book a 1 star. BUT when I thought it through, I still loved Allegiant and I realized that the rating should be based on EVERY part of the book, not just the ending. And again I found myself lost in the action, I fell in love with the dialogue, there were so many characters that I loved and loved to hate and I was enraptured with how the story progressed. I was so lost in this book that I was ignorant to think the ending could be what really happens. Looking back, I can see that Allegiant flows perfectly with how the two previous books progressed and it sticks with the theme Veronica Roth has created and doesn&#8217;t deviate from it. That in itself I highly value. Ultimately, I will read whatever Veronica Roth writes in the future BUT I will go into the books being realistic and knowing that I may need a huge box of tissues.This book starts off exactly where Insurgent left off. Tris and Christina are locked in a cell since Evelyn sees them as traitors and she and the factionless are now in charge of Chicago. Everyone, including Tris, is still reeling from Edith Prior&#8217;s revelation about what lies outside of the fence and that being Divergent is more important than they ever could have thought. When Tris and Christina are released as traitors they learn that there is a group, called the Allegiant, and they are allied with the original purpose of the city &#8211; sending people outside the city to help and living in factions. Upon hearing of this, Tris becomes resonate in her plans that she has to escape the city. She HAS to know what is out there. And again, from here I became completely absorbed in their world. Between the action, the knowledge we gain, how the relationships blossom and wither apart and the way the story progresses, Allegiant is addicting!This time we get to alternate between being in Tris&#8217; and Tobias&#8217; head. I loved being able to listen in to both of their thoughts and see the situations from both of their points of view. I loved being able to see the logical process of why Tris wanted to do certain things and then how Tobias viewed what Tris did and how he reacted to it. It made me feel as though I knew them both inside and out and I felt that much closer to them. I finally understand what makes them tick and why they both do the things they do. Sometimes they can be neurotic but in the end their love for each other is beautiful.I was so happy to see that Tris seems to have more of a grasp on who she is. Her compassion, her strength and her ability to analyze situations amazed me and even though she still struggled I felt as though she was confident with who she was and the choices she makes throughout the book. Tris is back to someone that I would want to stand behind in times of great unrest and danger. Tobias is a little bit different&#8230;&#8230;since we get to see inside Tobias&#8217; brain we finally get to see how much he struggles in this book. It reminds me of how Tris struggled in Insurgent. He is desperately trying not to become who is parents are and he is also struggling with trying to figure out what is really right and wrong. Even though I wanted to yell at him a few times he is still sexy as ever. His love and loyalty for Tris is a force to reckon with and I think that&#8217;s what makes me love him the most.I LOVED the huge revelation of what was outside the city. I was so excited to find out that it went along with what I thought from the beginning when Tris sees that the gates on the city&#8217;s fence lock from the outside and not the inside. Overall, I love this series. Did I wish it ended differently&#8230;.uhh yeah! But in the real world and Divergent you don&#8217;t always get what you want.

{"reviewTime": "10 30, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Allegiant is the third and final book of the Divergent trilogy written by Veronica Roth. (However, additional novellas will be published throughout 2013 and 2014.) It is a story of explosive truths, plot twists and turns, and an intense ending that every reader has their own thoughts about, ranging from bittersweet to outright hatred. You will have to read it yourself and find your own closure in this intelligent, young adult, dystopian story.&#8220;Sometimes, all it takes to save people from a terrible fate is one person willing to do something about it.&#8221;My favorite things about this book: Allegiant stayed consistent with the characters&#8217; value systems. The beliefs the factions have instilled in each character shines through their actions in this story. However, the factions themselves take a backburner in this book. &#8220;I don&#8217;t belong to Abnegation, or Dauntless, or even the Divergent... I belong to the people I love, and they belong to me- they, and the love and loyalty I give them, form my identity far more than any word or group ever could. &#8211; Tris&#8221; The author did not compromise any of the characters&#8217; integrity, but complimented it with themes of truth, forgiveness, love, sacrifice, and bravery. After being &#8220;inside the walls&#8221; for the first two books, the reader gets outside the factions and learns what &#8220;divergent&#8221; is and what it means for the characters. This added some new and interesting content to this final installment, although the telling of the information was at times slow. The epilogue was a nice touch given the shocking ending.My least favorite things about this book: I found it difficult to fully invest myself in a large portion of this book. Initially, I thought it was because I was reading while traveling and my reading settings were not ideal. However, reflecting back I realize that Allegiant was like reading a whole new book outside of the Divergent series. Yes, Tris, Tobias, and all of the remaining characters from Insurgent (book #2) were in it but the story is in a different setting, there are new characters added, and the story features a whole new reality. Oh, and it&#8217;s dual narration! After finishing the book, I realized how important the dual narration was at the end but it was slightly confusing throughout the beginning and middle of the book. First, I would forget whose perspective I was reading throughout chapters and I had to flip back a few pages to remind myself. Although each chapter begins with the name of the narrator, it wasn&#8217;t always easy to tell who the narrator was based on the content and thoughts. Second, I was confused by being in Tobias&#8217; head because he&#8217;s not as strong as he appears on the outside, he&#8217;s more damaged that I thought and I wasn&#8217;t prepared for that. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it would feel, to hate your own history and to crave love from the people who gave that history to you at the same time. How have I never seen the schism inside his heart? How have I never realized before that for all the strong, kind parts of him, there are also hurting, broken parts?&#8221; &#8211; Tris (about Tobias)My favorite quotes:&#8220;&#8216;A lot of the younger people think you&#8217;re downright heroic.&#8217; &#8216;Oh, good,&#8217; I say, a sour taste in my mouth. &#8216;Heroism is what I was focused on. Not, you know, trying not to die.&#8217;&#8221; &#8211; Tris&#8220;So much space. I wonder what it&#8217;s like in the places beyond ours; I wonder how people live there. I look out the window again, taking slow, deep breaths into a body to tense to move. And as I stare out at the land, I think that this, if nothing else, is compelling evidence for my parents&#8217; God, that our world is so massive that it is completely out of our control, that we cannot possibly be as large as we feel. So small as to be negligible. It&#8217;s strange, but there&#8217;s something in that thought that makes me feel almost&#8230;free.&#8221; &#8211; Tris&#8220;I used to think that when people fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward. And maybe that&#8217;s true of beginnings, but it&#8217;s not true of this, now. I fell in love with him. But I don&#8217;t just stay with him by default as if there&#8217;s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.&#8221; &#8211; Tris&#8220;To me, when someone wrongs you, you both share the burden of that wrongdoing-the pain of it weighs on both of you. Forgiveness, then, means choosing to bear the full weight all by yourself. Caleb&#8217;s betrayal is something we both carry, and since he did it, all I&#8217;ve wanted is for him to take its weight away from me. I am not sure I&#8217;m capable of shouldering it all myself-not sure that I am strong enough, or good enough.&#8221; &#8211; Tris&#8220;&#8216;Yeah, sometimes life really sucks,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But you know what I&#8217;m holding on for?&#8217; I raise my eyebrows. She raises hers, too, mimicking me. &#8216;The moments that don&#8217;t suck,&#8217; she says. &#8216;The trick is to notice them when they come around.&#8217;&#8230;Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one.

Veronica Roth found that missing piece in Allegiant. The story is powerful, intriguing, and emotionally gripping. It is a mature romance between two teens who had to grow up too fast ... two teens who show unfathomable strength. Tris's choice at the end is a beautiful demonstration of her selfless, brave, and intellectual divergence, following on the cusp of an honest conversation with someone she loves.In the conclusion to the series, we learn what lies beyond the experiment known as Chicago: The Bureau of Genetic Welfare. And what a bureau it is! Its location at O'Hare Airport is perfect, and learning about the Purity Wars and the origin of the factions is fascinating.&#34;I tick off each quality in my mind -- fear, low intelligence, dishonesty, aggression, selfishness. He IS talking about the factions. And he's right to say that every faction loses something when it gains a virtue: the Dauntless, brave but cruel; the Erudite, intelligent but vain; the Amity, peaceful but passive; the Candor, honest but inconsiderate; the Abnegation, selfless but stifling.&#34;I was thrilled to hear Four's perspective in about half of the chapters, though I agree with a Goodreads friend Brooke who stated that Tris's and Four's POVs are not distinct enough. Four's story is heartbreaking.&#34;I have never had parents who set good examples, parents whose expectations were worth living up to, but she did. I can see them within her, the courage and the beauty they pressed into her like a handprint.&#34;Four shows that he is anything but &#34;genetically damaged&#34;. Genes vs environment? The Bureau leans too heavily on genes, forgetting that our experiences also shape us. And Four is so strong that he turns the environmental pressures he experienced into resilience, not weakness.I find the abuses of government to be appalling, and the cautionary tale about those abuses to be timely.&#34;It's not hard for me to believe that the Bureau would do bad things, because every government I've ever known has done bad things.&#34;In the end, this story is about love, especially the sacrifices we make for those we love.&#34;That's what love does, when it's right -- it makes you more than you were, more than you thought you could be.&#34;I hear they will likely split Allegiant into two films, and I can't wait to see who they cast as David and Matthew.

{"reviewTime": "01 2, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I just finished ALLEGIANT, the third and final sequel in the DIVERGENT series by Veronica Roth.  It would be a disservice to give away anything that happens to the major characters, but I have to say that Roth&#8217;s writing is as brave and convention-shattering as her main characters.  She demonstrates that Young Adult fiction does not have to be safe and comfortable for its audience.Out of the series, I still love DIVERGENT the best because of the newness of the world and the uncertainty and challenge facing the main character Tris as she leaves the self-effacing faction of her childhood for the most wild, dangerous, and even reckless faction for her future.  The story follows the conventions of other dystopian series&#8217; like LEGEND and HUNGER GAMES but stands on its own.  The second book in the series INSURGENT explores the world that was set up to its limits and then breaks it wide open.  I didn&#8217;t know what to expect from ALLEGIANT.  Story-wise, I was lost on some of the details of this second-new world where genetic testing and purity, damage and reconstruction are behind everything I thought to be true.  But from a character standpoint, Roth took a leap and pushed her characters beyond anything I&#8217;ve read so far.  And I realized as I was reading that I didn&#8217;t know how she was going to wrap it up.  It stopped following convention.  And that&#8217;s when I became afraid.Like many of these dystopian series, the teenage girl at the center of the story makes decisions with as much logic and analysis as she can muster with a default gut-reaction in her back pocket.  They tend to be smarter than average, know their own physical limits, and willing to push themselves past all those limitations when necessary.  In the real world, the fact that these girls&#8217; decisions end up being the right thing to do would be mostly due to luck, but in these series&#8217; these profound consequences are a testament to the girls&#8217; special qualities.  The message is clear: Be smart, young ladies.  Be brave.  Think before you act, don&#8217;t let emotions get the best of you.  And if you must take a leap of faith.In the real world, those leaps of faith for a teenager are based on crazy hormonal shifts and raging emotions.  While I agree with the sentiment behind these character traits, I don&#8217;t know how well they translate.  Honestly it&#8217;s confusing being a girl sometimes.  I grew up with the whole-hearted belief that I could have a thrilling, passionate, demanding career in a difficult field and still have an incredibly rare marriage and perfect children that I would have time to raise and money to support.  I&#8217;m not saying this isn&#8217;t possible, but as life has surprised me along the way, I have realized that the reality of this belief is not at all like the fantasy in my head.  With the pressures women have to be thin, have flawless skin, be perfect and smart and strong and feminine, there is no room for error as these girls navigate into their womanhood.  I think of Miley Cyrus who in all reality is doing exactly what she should be doing as a young, passionate, creative woman.  She is being vilified for not being a role model and yet rewarded for her crazy behavior with media attention and money.  How will she navigate into adulthood?  Obviously celebrities are a special breed and again the translation to us normal humans is not one-to-one, but still I hope you see my point.The most important aspect of these dystopian young adult series&#8217; is that these strong female characters face dangers and actually lose something in the process.  They face the compromise of life and find a way to keep living.  I can&#8217;t really recall a story from my formative pre-teen/teen years that offered such a mature outlook on life and the future.  The ones that come to mind all offer some kind of replacement solution, usually in the form of a man/relationship.  In many ways, it&#8217;s heartbreaking to read ALLEGIANT now, as a parent, because I don&#8217;t want to think about loss and disappointment for my own children even though I know it&#8217;s inevitable.  And worse, I know that loss, disappointment, and failure are all the best teachers to becoming a better person.  They can do the opposite as well, but handing someone something on a silver platter doesn&#8217;t seem to have done much good for anyone I know.  Fighting for what you want, failing and having to figure out which battle to fight is key to understanding oneself and others.In adult fiction, I keep my guard up as a reader, knowing that all bets are off, but in YA I tend to think there&#8217;s a safety in the genre that things will be realistic but not that real.  ALLEGIANT blew me away because it shattered all the safe promises the other series keep.  What is salvaged from the wreckage of the story is true and beautiful and heartbreaking and the best thing anyone can pass on to the next generation.  I literally sobbed at the end.  I don&#8217;t want to leave these characters.  I don&#8217;t want to admit that Roth ultimately took my expectations and used them against me and I played right into her gifted hands.As a fellow writer, and one who likes to break conventions, I salute you Veronica Roth.

I heard the author even received death threats.  While that is crazy, extreme, and never ok, after finishing the book I understand the disappointment. And a little bit of anger.  After all, the first book was really good.  Tris and Four were so compelling.  I grew to care about them: about their fight, their happiness, their evolution.  And all I am left with now, is a hollow feeling and the resounding question, why would any author do this to her fans?I'm not going to spoil the ending. Just in case, like me, you have managed to avoid spoilers up until this point, I am not going to be the one to ruin it for you. I'll let Veronica Roth do that for herself.  I will say that I am not sorry I took the journey with these characters. I just wish this final installment had gone a different way.It's not like the ending was the only issue I had with the book, though.  I was a little let down that Insurgent veered so far from the tone and core of Divergent.  But here, we literally leave everything behind for an entirely new world altogether.  Things get so out of hand in Chicago, our main characters leave and start all over again outside the walls. It's a completely different society, but almost all the problems are the same.  The same disparities, prejudice, rebellion and machinations, only with a slightly different spin to fit the new world.  It felt too heavy handed and convenient that so much happening inside the city mirrored what was happening outside.That wasn't the worst thing, however.  No. Other than the horrible ending, the worst part of this book was the destruction of Tobias.  He is almost unrecognizable from the character we got to know in the first two books.  Yes, he was flawed before, and he had some issues. But here, he is a hot mess. He has lost his quiet surety, his inner strength and compass.  He is basically a whiny idiot for much of the book.  This is made even more obvious because the book is told in alternating POVs between him and Tris.  I thought that I would like that in the beginning, but I didn't... primarily because Roth did not give these characters distinct enough voices.  Even though each chapter was labeled with who was narrating, sometimes I would forget whose POV we were in.  It just didn't work.  Now that the story is over, I understand why Roth did it, but that knowledge really doesn't help.It wasn't all terrible.  Tris has improved since the last book. She's grown some --and I cared about what was happening with her. I cared about her stupid relationship with Tobias.  And I can definitely say nothing about the book was predictable. So there's that.Bottom line, should you read it?  Well, if you read Divergent and you like it, you will no doubt have to read it.  The books in the trilogy are too intertwined not to.  As in the Hunger Games trilogy, book 1 is great. Book 2 is ok, but has a major cliffhanger.  And book 3 makes you want a stiff drink. Take that knowledge and do with it as you will.  I can't imagine how they'll get away with this ending in the theaters.  They'll be throwing popcorn at the screen and demanding their money back.", "reviewerName": "Jen \"Red Hot Books\"", "summary": "Why would an author do this to fans?", "helpful": [3, 3], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1388102400, "reviewerID": "ABUY5XK1R4YYZ"}

So beware!**Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed Allegiant much more than Insurgent. But I didn't enjoy it as much as Divergent. I think this is a common trend with trilogies. First book rocks. Second book drags. Third book rocks and drags.Unlike its predecessors, Allegiant went back and forth between two POV's: Tris and Tobias. Overall, I enjoyed this updated format. In fact, I wish Veronica Roth had written the first two books this way. The varying perspectives added a deeper dimension, propelled the story forward faster, and gave the reader a break from Tris (who, lets face it, can be borderline unlikeable at times). My only complaint about this new format: I kept forgetting if I was reading from Tris or Tobias's POV. Because it's written in first person, and because Tris and Tobias are so similar, I'd end up reading entire chapters thinking I was inside the others head. Friends of mine have also complained about this issue. I think a simple solution would've been to add Tris or Tobias's name at the top of each page, or even use the strategy of Marie Lu's Legend with different font colors.**Okay, I'm going to tread into Spoilerville here. I must. Sorry.**The ending. Wow. Just...wow. I'm sure many people will disagree with me, but I liked it. I thought Tris's fate made perfect sense and fit the book's theme of \"choice\". And, come on, this was never a happy series. Death and despair and WTF-just-happened? moments were always the norm. I'm still trying to figure out if I liked how Tris died. At one minute I think, \"Well, it makes sense\", but then the next I think, \"Really? Gunshot? Really?\" I suppose I'm leaning towards the \"Well, it makes sense\" side. Just like the death serum, Tris made a choice to get shot. Even though she knew it would mean death if she lunged for the button to release the memory serum, she did it anyways to save those she loved. I liked that.I must applaud Veronica Roth for having the guts and boldness to kill off her main protagonist. I'm so used to YA series ending in a shower of glitter and flutter of butterflies. Even Hunger Games had a sorta happy ending, with Katniss and Peeta building a life together. But Allegiant ended horribly realistically, and, in this case, logically...At least Veronica Roth gave the reader a sliver of satisfaction by taking us a couple of years into the future with Four to see how he's dealing with Tris's death and how the world Tris died for is faring.Even so, it was a bittersweet ending to a bittersweet series.For more book reviews, visit jenspenden.wordpress.com.", "reviewerName": "jenspenden \"jenspenden\"", "summary": "Book Review: Allegiant", "helpful": [2, 3], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1384300800, "reviewerID": "A1AOAG1GGPLSHL"}

I probably wont though, its the first time in my life I am not finishing a series and its disappointing. I just got the Kindle sample of this book that included the first 5 chapters, they were awful. I felt like someone else wrote these, it didnt seem like I was reading the same Tris. Also, the POV's are exactly the same. Its pretty bad when you have a 18-20 year old boy that sounds exactly like a 16 year old girl. Other reviews saying the same thing (and the fact that it did not improve throughout the book) made me just give up and not waste my money. Also, I usually dont write reviews...or give only one star...unless I just cant continue with a book(only one other book every got 1 star from me) But this was just disappointing and doesnt give me any desire at all to finish it.**Update 12/27/13***May contain Spoilers*This is my first major review of a book. Normally I just rate with stars, but since I really liked the first two and couldnt stand this book I thought it required more of an explanation. I dont have the writing skills or literary insight as some of these reviewers but I will try my best.Ok I couldnt help myself and a friend talked me into it. (I read her copy, Thank goodness because I would have been furious if I paid for it.)I really liked Divergent and Insurgent. But from the very beginning i knew I wouldnt like this book, although I tried to keep an open mind. The whole tone of the book was different. Tris didnt sound like the Tris I came to love in the first two(Tobias wasnt very Tobias either). The POV's were executed very poorly. Usually if you have multiple POVs it adds insight into the character, their world and their situation. Not in this book. Tobias and Tris were generally together throughout the book, and when they werent they would relay the information to each other anyways making the whole thing very repetitive. And again, Tris and Tobias POV's were written exactly the same. You could only tell who was narrating by situation cues.The whole plot was overly complicated and left wholes in the story. The GP's changed their genes because people were bad, but the GD's are bad and the GPs never created war? Doesnt that contradict itself right there. Just totally out there and made barely any sense once so ever. I think she tried to layer the plot but instead it just seemed all over the place and just event after event without having too much to do with eachother. For example theres been this big pending war built up between the Allegiant and the factionless but then wait forget about that were going outside the fence and Tobias is going to join a different rebel cause. Then at the end he just goes back to ask his mom if she will stop the Allegiant/factionless war and just like that its over? (Not the Evelyn we knew either) Just the whole thing didnt seem to sync well with me.Now the ending. Like other people have said, I do not need a happy ending to like a book. Not at all. (As you can see earlier I barely even gave this book a chance before I got to the end) I actually knew about her death before I even started reading Insurgent. I was excited to read the story and see how it got there. Usually when main/favorite characters die there is a reason for it, it propels the story further, it has a purpose that changed the course of everything thats currently set in motion. Not this. Tris's death had no meaning at all, I understand that she would want to take Calebs place because she loves him. But Caleb needed a redemption and that was his one true shot at it and she took it from him in the name of love. So Tris is some sort of superhuman and is somehow the only one ever to survive the death serum. Just in time to get shot, but of course right after she went there to do what she needed to.(What the hell) But the thing that made me most mad about her death was how her mother greeted her. I would not think her mom would just show up and pull her to death (especially after sacrificing herself so her daughter could live). I would think if she did have a vision of her moms spirit (ghost, whatever) that her mom would be urging her to hang on to life not pulling her to death.The only part I remotely liked about this book was Tobias's grieving. It was the only part that felt real and full of emotion to me. (even though he still didnt sound like the Tobias in the first two) But again, Tris's death did not propel his story further either. I believe he would have faced his fears with her too(he already has in the past in the fear landscape)Im not sure what was going through Ms. Roths mind when she wrote this. Seems to me maybe she just wanted to get it over with, IDK but definitely not the trilogy I thought I would love. This book was the most disappointing series finale I have ever read. I will definitely not be reading it again. (I had already read the first two twice but Im done with that now)I wish I had listened to my instinct and not let my friend talk me into this.

Sacrifice isn&#8217;t giving away other people&#8217;s lives for the good of everyone.  True sacrifice can only come from within yourself with the desire to truly help others no matter the cost to you.  I liked how Allegiant explored the idea of a good or evil sacrifice.  I liked the ending, though it did give me a major hangover that I had to discuss with my husband for an hour or two before I could move on.  I think the ending was tragic, gutsy, and really tied all the books together and stuck with the theme of the series. I also really liked Veronica Roth&#8217;s explanation of why she ended it the way she did.Even though I liked the book overall, I did have a lot of issues with it that seriously hindered my enjoyment.  My biggest complaint was how slow the middle was.  There should be a PSA in the middle of the book that says, &#8220;We would like to interrupt this conflict to bring you All The Answers for at least 100 pages. Thank you.&#8221; Yeah. I was bored.  Not a lot actually happens for a huge portion of the middle of the book.  The answers of what was really on the outside of the fence was not really what I expected based on the ending of Insurgent.  And I don&#8217;t understand Tris&#8217; anger for the people outside the fence not helping.  First she was mad that they were meddling in their lives and then she&#8217;s all mad that they weren&#8217;t?? Make up your mind!I think the secondary characters would make really good cardboard cutouts for a movie.  I can just see Luke Skywalker turn around after he wins his medal and see the entire secondary cast of Allegiant.  I could not tell any of them apart.  I could not remember who was who.  I was constantly googling all the secondary people.  If Veronica Roth is going to just assume I know who all these characters are just by their name, then please don&#8217;t make them so flat and boring.The romance was okay.  It was a lot of kissing and then getting mad at each other.  But it had it&#8217;s moments that I really liked.  I think my favorite was this quote from Tris:I fell in love with him. But I don&#8217;t just stay with him by default as if there&#8217;s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other.

Yes, it was hugely flawed, often evil and corrupt... But they were still enchanting.  The amity in their apple orchards, strumming banjos and laughing... The dauntless hanging around the the chasm or boisterously scaling the pit, all covered In tattoos and black... The cool blue and glass erudite, the frank and unflinching black-and-white Candor...

Yes, I dislike the ending and found it profoundly lacking, but I'll save that for last.First of all, despite it being YA, I still expect it to be decently written and engaging- and Allegiant suffered on both accounts. The dual viewpoints between Tris and Four sounded like a good concept, and one I was ready to get behind...but in practice it's messy, non-cohesive and somehow despite the constant shifting, very monotonous. The first 2 books gave me the sense that Roth was really finding her voice and improving, so I was ready to forgive the first signs of these problems I saw; except that they continued throughout the entirety of the book. It became hard to recall if you were in Tris' POV or Four's, and the value of their separate perspectives suffered as a result. It got to the point where I really lost interest in the story altogether, only continuing in hopes that it would regain footing and reveal something worthwhile.I resisted the temptation to look into spoilers. So I read no reviews, didn't listen to Roth's explanation of her ending or even talk about the book with anyone further along. So my initial reaction was a very surprised, strongly negative one. I doubted very much that her words on the matter would change my thought, but I was still curious and did listen/read what she had to say. It left me somehow even more disappointed. So Tris was finally grown up, self-aware and ultimately WORTHY enough to sacrifice herself? That's her powerful, 'righteous' ending? I'm not saying it should have been a clear cut case of Tris and Four walking into the sunset, never to have further struggles or fighting to evolve further....but to say neither of them is deserving of the proper ending together; and that Tris finally became who she wanted, and who her parents would have been proud of, only to die is fitting- seems a little wrong to me. It seems to me Roth was just so desperate to be different and NOT have them 'ride into the sunset' that she felt the need to ruin any further development there could have been.So I muddled through the unimpressive writing, terrible POV shifting and struggles all for an ending that ruins everything leading up to it.

This was a fascinating world, with virtually unlimited opportunities for studying human nature. In Divergent, Roth does this very well. In Insurgent, she does it fairly well, but I felt it had a lot of pointless filler material, with not much newness. Allegiant is, absolutely without question in my mind, the most disappointing series finale I've ever read. There was no new material of any value. I did not connect with any of the new characters. The story line, through the first two books, was all about Tris. When the Point of View was split between Tris and Tobias in the third book, alarm bells went off. Frankly, she doesn't ever connect us to Tobias the way she did with Tris. I feel that this book (in addition to a pitifully unsatisfying ending) was rushed, and Ms. Roth does not have the writing chops to write a book this quickly and do it well. It is a lot of mind-numbing nothingness stretched out over too many pages, with very little actual story taking place, and no real mystery whatsoever.SPOILER ALERT:The ending of this book is utterly disappointing, not because Tris dies, but because the story dies. It was her story, and it feels incomplete, but it is oh, so very over. Several relentless chapters AFTER her pointless death reinforce to us just how over it is. Just in case you weren't sad enough, she piles it all on a bit more.No, I' not sad for Tris - all good characters have to end sometime. I'm sad for Veronica Roth, because she had hit on something that could have been genuinely big. At this point, I doubt they will even make the third film.

I am one of those people who become a part of the characters especially my favorite ones.I think that the way this book was written letting you get inside of Tris and Tobias was fabulous because I like him just as much as I like her and felt this helped to get to know his mind better and how he really feels and why he makes the choices he makes even when you are like WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT???? So to get to the point I had been looking forward to reading this book for a long time, ever since I finished the others for the first time (I have read them multiple times since)and even though I was disappointed in how it ended I have to give to to Veronica this is probably one of the only books/series I have read, and I read a lot, that seems to be like things happen in real life.  Tris and Tobias' relationship was not perfect and they loved each other for all of their flaws and good parts.

This helped him to know she really forgave him, it just killed me for Tobias because she really didnt want the result that happened in the end but didnt anticipate David being there waiting.

Oblivion and Elysium (movies) are the two most recent stories to do this.But this novel, then end of the trilogy, killing off the main character was just stupid. On so many levels. But mainly I am irritated because since book one Roth has been building up Tris as an individual, but also in her relationship with Four. Why would you spend three ENTIRE books helping these characters to grow together, and overcome so many obstacles that happen in real life with different circumstances? It gives the reader that hope, that maybe no matter how bad things get (and we went through a lot of terrible things with Tris and Four) you can get through them and things will be better.Roth has most of book 3 building up their relationship, and overcoming the same problem that happened in book 2, but with Tris realizing she will always forgive him. And then Roth kills her. It makes all of that writing seem like such a waste. If she hadn't built them up together, making that one of the major plot lines, then I think I would understand why she killed off Tris. If she did it for the greater good. But.....the reasons that were given felt like excuses.I agree with another reviewer, I think all the problems with this book (because killing of the main character is the worst, but definitely no the only one, why suddenly change the writing style from the first two books? I don't want Four's POV, I have her short stories for that.) I think Roth felt pressured writing this. It was like she cracked trying to write this. Maybe she felt limited by having to wrap it up in one book? My advice...then don't! She would have done so much better and honestly would have probably made more money. Finish it the way you want it.I think Trilogies cab fail because of this. Just write the story, if it's three books then call it a trilogy, but if it's not I'm perfectly happy to keep buying the series if it is a good series.I was in love with this series until I finished (almost) this book.

There's far less running, action, shooting, etc.. and far more discussion and angst from psychological issues. It's scientific and not battle-tastic.2) The ending is polarizing. There are some types of readers who will embrace it and some who will hate it.3) The POV jumps between Tris and Four, but they are almost indistinguishable (no seriously, I had to go back to the start of the chapter to check who it was sometimes). That's frustrating for a reader. It also means that much of the witty banter between our favorite couple has disappeared. They (sadly) spend a lot of time angry at one another.4) The side characters are MIA for most of the novel. Which is sad, because I think Roth did an excellent job creating other characters full of depth and life. The plot was slow to move due to an influx of information, and yet we received next to no information on how the other characters were handling this HUGE change in their world.So here's the bottom line: can you handle it if it doesn't end like a Hollywood perfectly packaged present? Yes, great - keep going.No? Stop now and pretend the third book wasn't written. Seriously.But all that said, I still loved Allegiant. Roth has a distinct writing style that I truly enjoyed, and I never felt that this was a slow moving or uninteresting novel.It did turn my perspective on Tris' world upside down because of the major revelations. I'm shocked that this is where Roth had intended to take the series all this time. The huge world outside of Tris' previous one is such an adjustment, and it almost makes you feel like all the heroic actions of Tris and Four are insignificant on this new grand scale. That's new. I like that they are thrust into a place neither of them can control or be top dog of.I truly loved the end and couldn't have seen a better way for it to go.

I simply don't have the energy to sit here and write an essay with pros and cons and observations and such....  So all I will say is this:  The ending; and what I mean by 'ending' is what happened to one of the main characters, did not bother me in the slightest, because the book was so completely and utterly annoying that if it wasn't written this way, I would be wishing that it had been.  The author is SO repetitive and has an extremely limited vocabulary.  (wiping the sweat off my hands, black spots clouding my vision, I'm so tiny and little) among others, are phrases that are used to the point of frustration.  The dual narrative was horrible.  Not because it was a dual narrative per se, but because the author was not good at it.  When you are writing for multiple characters you need to make sure they each have their own voice, their own personality, their own style of speaking and of thinking.  Tobias and Tris' dialogue were indistinguishable from one another.  In fact Tobias sounded SO MUCH like Tris, that he came off as effeminate, minimally, a bit of a pansy.  What self respecting Dauntless male, describes his mothers freakin' hairdo??  While the author did fine with male characters dialogues. (quotes) she did extremely poorly with the narrative, making this strapping male sound like a four foot girl.  The first book had a lot of promise, the second was even ok (though very repetitious descriptions) but by the third one I was so ready for this to be over so I could get on with my life and stop wasting my time.  I doubt that Hollywood will incorporate the writing flaws into the cinema version of this story so I will likely watch it, though I most definitely will not re-read the books, especially the third in this series.", "reviewerName": "JO", "summary": "My honest short and sweet review of Allegiant", "helpful": [2, 2], "overall": 1.0, "unixReviewTime": 1392595200, "reviewerID": "A3LEIV22DQ0E5T"}

At first I was shocked, HATED the idea of the outcome, but I was able to read the book with a different perspective. I concentrated more on plot and character development, looking more closely to clues as to why Ms. Roth chose this ending. And, people, it is her RIGHT as the author to do so. I wanted to join in and hate it and bash it like so many others but I find I really can't. So much of what made Tris tick was pleasing her parents and family. Family ties was a huge theme throughout the book, even with Tobias, Tori, Christina, Uriah....Time and time again Tris would &#34;hear&#34; her parents' advice in her head. Saving Caleb was the ultimate selfless expression of her love for him, her obligation...I suspect Veronica Roth wanted to be remembered as the author who did NOT present us with a total happy ending..like Stephenie Myers did in Breaking Dawn, like Suzanne Collins did in Mocking Jay, like JK Rowling did with Harry Potter. But I feel like the shock ending only created the much needed drama that the mostly blah story line did not do. I sense she wanted to deliver a message to her YA audience about the hard knocks life presents you. But I also feel we readers could have been led to believe we had lost Tris, only to have her rehab out of sight and reappear....because we need those happy endings in our lives somewhere - what better place than in our dystopian/ fantasy series?So I  and so many others won't have that comfortable feeling a happy ending brings.

{"reviewTime": "11 6, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Allegiant was one of my anticipated books of 2013, I really didn't know how Veronica Roth could wrap up the series successfully. Allegiant was panned by fans and many fans felt that this book ruined the entire series for them. Then there's me, one of the few \"black sheeps\" who actually enjoyed this book and felt that it was extremely necessary that it ended this way.Allegiant is nearly impossible to describe because there's just so many subplots going on at the same time. At any given moment, there are at least 5 or 6 different storylines that Roth is telling and it's a bit overwhelming at times. This is definitely the most complicated of all of the books in the series and I guess it makes sense, given the fact that Roth needed to somehow conclude the series in a satisfying way.Finally readers will learn what being \"divergent\" really means for Tris and Four. Tris and Four's relationship is definitely tested in this one and there is a lot of bickering between the two. I just wanted them to make up and just resolve their differences; it does make sense that they are constantly on edge due to hectic nature of their lives. When there aren't fighting (which wasn't very often), there were some very sweet moments between the two. The romance in this one is pretty light, but we do get to see more of what's going on in Four's head.I completely understand why Veronica Roth decided to write in Tris and Four's point of views, but it wasn't up to par with the high quality writing that was evident in previous books. There were times when Tris and Four sounded way too similar and I had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to find out whose point of view I was reading. There were other times when I had really enjoy Four's point of view because it was extremely revealing and it was completely unbarred. The reader slowly learns to understand why Four is such an enigmatic force and why he keeps himself so reserved from Tris. I really felt like Four's point of view was extremely vital to understanding who he is and how much he cares for Tris. I do wish that the writing was tighter in some of Four's chapters to make his voice more distinct for the reader.The side characters in Allegiant have been called undeveloped and unimaginative by so many reviewers, but I disagree. All of the secondary characters (both new and familiar faces) place an extremely important part in helping Four and Tris make decisions. The secondary characters help raise the stakes, they help Four and Tris realize that everything isn't going to end perfectly like they had hoped. Each character has their own specific purpose and rightful place in Allegiant, it was truly something special to see my favorite characters from the series interact with new characters.I have to address the way Allegiant ended because it's caused so much controversy  Veronica Roth received death threats after fans had read the ending. IT'S NEVER OKAY TO SEND SOMEONE DEATH THREATS, I thought that was common sense, but apparently not. The ending of Allegiant is so ballsy and was such a risky move on Veronica Roth's part; Roth had the guts to pull off something most authors wouldn't even dream of doing. This is why Roth has sold millions of books because she pushes the limits and is always creating ingenious plotlines. Anyway, I felt that this ending felt inevitable, Roth even said that she always felt like she knew it would end like this. After a bit of pondering, it all made sense to me and I felt like Roth had been leading up to this ending ever since Divergent. In fact, if you read Insurgent, there's tons of foreshadowing that hinted that Allegiant would end like this. Allegiant's ending felt necessary to me and I really feel that this is the ONLY ending that truly would have worked. While I didn't love the ending, I felt that Allegiant's conclusion was extremely effective.Though Allegiant is extremely slow-paced and slugs due to info-dumping, I really enjoyed the final installment in the Divergent trilogy. Allegiant didn't provide readers with the happily ever after that readers were looking for, instead it provided readers with an extremely realistic ending. As much as I would have loved Four and Tris to ride into the sunset on an unicorn, Allegiant had to end in such a manner. Allegiant has solidified my love for Veronica Roth's writing abilities and it ended on a satisfying note, in my mind. I really look forward to reading Roth's future books and I hope that Roth will continue to defy all odds with her incredible books. There's no denying that Veronica Roth is dauntless after reading Allegiant, it takes an extremely brave and daring individual to write an extremely controversial ending without fearing retaliation from fans.", "reviewerName": "Jon (Scott Reads It!)", "summary": "A Heartbreaking, Bold Ending!", "helpful": [1, 6], "overall": 4.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383696000, "reviewerID": "A1L5WAZAL5H1SA"}

Unfortunately, all I could think is &#34;this isn't what the characters would actually have done&#34;. It's like she forced the characters personalities to change in order to create a certain kind of ending. For instance, Tobias would have known Tris well enough to know she wouldn't just let her brother die for her. Her personality wasn't designed to let someone she loves die when she could take their place.Evelyn wouldn't have just stopped her war against the Allegiant because her son asked  her to. If it wasn't THAT important to her, she wouldn't have killed people over it. Again, it's like Veronica manipulated the character's personalities to fit the ending she had in mind. There are other plot holes but either way, it felt like Veronica had one ending in mind and formed her story according to it, even if it meant she didn't keep her characters true to themselves.Also, this is solely from my POV.

Even though I had been a big fan of the first two novels in the series, it had been a good while since I had read them.  I didn't have the patience to go back and re-read, so off we went.  It didn't take long for me to get drawn back into the world of Tobias and Tris, factions, and terrible choices.  I had a hard time keeping track of some of the supporting characters, and this was the only thing that made me wish I had taken the time to re-read the first two books.I have no urge to ruin the plot by describing it here.  Many fans have been waiting on pins and needles to see what happens and they won't be disappointed.  There are surprises, twists and turns, and then even more twists and turns.  I was dazzled by the author's plotting skill as she laid out a careful web of deceits and half-truths that are sure to keep readers turning the pages, much as I did, looking for the truths that always seemed to lurking just beneath the surface of what our heroes were being told.This story is told in alternating chapters by both Tris and Tobias.  I will admit that I was not a fan of this method.  The author did not do a very good job of giving them distinctive voices, often leaving me confused as to who was speaking.  I believe this robbed the narrative of some of its energy, leading to a pace that was slow, and an overall tone that was far less suspenseful and dramatic than it should have been.While I admired the author's plotting skill as she introduced so many new elements, I did end up feeling that some were contrived.  She slipped into quite a bit of telling instead of showing, and if I hadn't been so interested in where she was going, I might have ended up feeling frustrated pretty early on.  As it was, I was captivated by the story and the society, and intrigued by the many ethical questions offered up in the book.  The author has a firm grip on the dystopian world she has created and uses it to widely explore questions of equality and free will.I was all set to assign a three star rating to Allegiant until I came to the last eighty pages or so.  The drama and emotion that was somewhat lacking in the book, came at me full force in an ending that was brave and exciting and totally unexpected.

Each chapter flips between Tris and Tobias's (Four) perspective. Also the story takes a twist, like a Joss Whedon movie when it goes outside the city. With this twist the story could have gone on with a few more books perhaps but maybe the author was tired of the characters and story so wrapped it up here. Other things I liked about the last book is that the characters are maturing, however, in the end, the thing that makes half the readers unhappy with this book is the concept of change, ultimate love, and sacrifice. None of which Tris or Tobias has yet to experience but yet go through the motions of living. Maybe if they had a younger brother or sister, or maybe after they have their own kids would this concept be more acceptable. Though I didn't find this as bothersome, I think there was ample opportunity to extend the story, but what I felt a little cheated because the ending wraps up too neatly and cleanly, all of a sudden all is well in the world and only sadness and moving on remains and everyone is depressed and sad, the fight is gone. It happened way too fast without much exposition.Some points I agree with from other readers...There is no difference in between Tris and Tobias between chapters, it's difficult to tell them apart, it is all one voice.The ending wraps up too neatly and cleanly.The bigger world was given to us but it could have been bigger and the story longerOverall, a good book but I can think of a few ideas that would have kept the series going in and outside the factions. The characters could have developed further rather than putting them all in a situation that they accept willingly after fighting so hard for their own concept of individuality. And what happened to the Divergent? Why are they not involved as much in the books when in the bigger picture, it's all about them? Where is the crowds and crowds of Divergent that have been hiding?

And to be honest, for someone who fought so hard and never had that chance to live through it...makes it even more worst. For all its worth, it's just a big sad, sad ending...even her death was just not fitting as a conclusion to the series, what exactly was the point of her death played in the end about?

I can't believe a publisher would actually print this ...other than to keep the money machine going.Spoilers:First of all, the idea that they are living in  Chicago and have no idea what lies so close to them outside the fence should be explained.  Its so ridiculous that with a faction that values facts and knowledge, no one would never attempt to  go outside the fence...and just miles past the fence is a whole city/compound that flies planes for goodness sake.  Even in fiction ,this is ludicrous and draws the reader (at least me) so far out of the story I can't buy into any of it.  A well thought out plot would have weaved these answers in from the beginning.The POV writing style DOES NOT WORK if both characters have the exact same voice, attitude, style.  And who are these characters?  Tobias and Tris are  written so completely differently than the last books it was like reading a whole new series. I hated them in Allegiant, but only because I was already bought into the original characters  the author sold me on in the last 2 books.Furthermore, the plot also slowed down with little to no suspense once they were 'outside the fence'. Instead you get chapters of information dump so the author can try to fill in gaps and throw this plot together.  YAWN!I had to put the book down 2/3 of the way through because I just couldn't take it anymore.

I tried to avoid reading reviews until I read the book but even just scrolling through my social media feeds, I could see something severe was going to happen.  I had an idea of what it might be, and while I was on the right track, I didn&#8217;t quite guess it.  This is going to be a spoiler-free review.I really liked the explanations in the beginning of Allegiant after the group went outside Chicago&#8217;s city limits. The truth about the factions in Chicago and the existence of the Divergent made so much sense to me. That part got scientific and I enjoyed that. I liked that this was a smart book. I always wondered why the scenario with the factions was going on only inside Chicago. While reading the first book I wondered whether the rest of the country still existed in this world, or if it was all a wasteland with Chicago being the last with a civilization. So I found the additional world building in Allegiant to be very satisfying.However, the remainder of the book, leading up to the epic ending, was very political and a bit dull with all the strategy and discussions. I get that it was necessary, but it dragged for me. I also had a lot of anxiety since I knew something awful was going to happen, but I didn&#8217;t know what or when. I had even more anxiety when I realized what was going to happen, and that it was going to happen soon.The relationship between Tris and Tobias went through some tests in this book but the two of them are so strong together that I believed that they could work through anything.  I did like how Tobias was less than perfect in this book. In the past he always seemed to be the best at everything, to me at least, so I liked to see him being more vulnerable. Though, the ending was more than anyone should have to endure.So, that ending. On one hand it makes perfect sense. I wouldn&#8217;t have expected anything less from this character (no spoilers here). But on the other hand&#8230; OMG!! Yes, it was an epic way to end the trilogy, but was it truly necessary? The end goal would have been accomplished with or without that something awful, even if the author says it was in the plan all along (you can read about it on her blog, but DO NOT read it if you haven&#8217;t read the book yet unless you want the ending spoiled). I do agree that this character&#8217; journey throughout this series was leading up to this decision, and this choice really did define this character. BUT, making that choice was the defining moment in this character&#8217;s development. The actual outcome could have been different and wouldn&#8217;t have changed the strength of that choice. Yes, that epic ending was powerful and so so painful. And yes, that makes this ending so dramatic. But I don&#8217;t agree that it was absolutely necessary.

Four and Tris had beauty in strength, character, etc but it wasn't until the darker or less appealing sides became visible that you could really see it.  Some people are able to acknowledge those negative traits without allowing them to take control and some people sadly never overcome them. (ex. without spoilers-the one that took the memory serum) Some can't face or acknowledge any negativity and therefore stall never moving forward even if they aren't going backwards. They will never know how strong and beautiful they could be if they would push through. Not to say that everyone can do it alone, which I think was addressed in Allegiant. For all the physical and mental strength that Four had, he couldn't accept all of himself and therefore was weak even if nobody saw it. It wasn't until he came full circle to really see this side of him and allow others to see and help that he became truly strong. Some people found the plot holes as a negative but I don't agree. I liked the author's lack of details. It wasn't clear as to how things changed or why people accepted the way things were without question for generations. Yet I think that is one of the major points of the book. Things happen in the world that baffle people every day yet do these same people take action or sit idly by allowing change to gradually happen whether good or bad. In Allegiant the sculpture was a prime example of this. Tris's view of the sculpture was different than that of the scientists but just as valid. I will even take it one step farther by saying just as the water was slowly changing the stone below one drip at a time, future viewers may not realize the stone's original appearance was drastically different. The ones that were present to see the slow change may be so accustomed to it that they don't even realize or acknowledge it happening or remember the original beauty without proof. Hopefully now you can understand my acceptance of the author not filling in all the plot holes in a less abstract way as I  am quite capable of filling them in myself. For me it was more important to learn the above lesson than to know the exact who's, what's, or ifs. Some reviews disliked the science of the book. The were caught up in the impossibilities found throughout which I can see cumbersome to some but for me I was able to believe for the sake of the story. In the end, I found the book  inspiring without preaching, suggestive of self worth but not love of self,  thoughtful teaching of the different dynamics of relationships, and proof that things are not always as they seem. Beyond that I found the best ending isn't always the one we want but what we do with it that makes the difference.", "reviewerName": "kahlanne", "summary": "Suprisingly insightful (as spoiler free as possible )", "helpful": [3, 8], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewerID": "A1ODR55X7AYEZ1"}

Without giving too much away, there is a big, EMOTIONAL event at the end of the book that upset MANY people. On top of that many felt the books was a lot slower paced, they were frustrated with the change in the POV, and--from what I can tell--many many people found Allegiant to be their least favorite of the series.For me, it's a pretty close second favorite. If it had had a little bit more action and better pacing I might have enjoyed it more than Divergent. But other than that I really enjoyed most of Veronica Roth's choices with this story, particularly everything she did with the ending.I sobbed. I have not cried this hard over a fantasy/science fiction novel since Half Blood Prince. But I had to put Allegiant down more than once. I just couldn't control the feels, there were so many.Tris was the strongest her character has been in the entire series. She was my absolute favorite throughout it. So much growth and strength and bravery. At the beginning of the series Veronica told us Tris was supposed to be selfless AND brave AND intelligent. But it wasn't until Allegiant that she really SHOWED us.Everything about this ending was elegant and beautiful and emotional. It is a truly memorable and stirring ending. It makes all the frustration I felt throughout the second book so very worth it.All around I give it 4 stars.", "reviewerName": "Kait", "summary": "A truly emotional ending to a series", "helpful": [1, 4], "overall": 4.0, "unixReviewTime": 1393977600, "reviewerID": "A17KE8XWUYK9QF"}
{"reviewTime": "04 4, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "First of all, I loved Divergent. It was fast paced and full of action and drama and surprises. Insurgent was also action packed. I loved the conflict and the growth of the characters. Now, my mistake was reading Allegiant, but in my defence, I didn't know what I was getting myself into (just like everybody else).Okay, I had really high expectations for this book, especially since it was the LAST ONE of this series. At first, I liked it and I liked how Roth gave us insight to both Tobias and Tris' point of views. However, when they went through that gate and out of the city, the story took on a different turn for me. At first I didn't like it at all but then it became tolerable after a while. I didn't like how we really had no clear idea of what was going on inside the city with the Allegiant and the Factionless. Just little snapshots on a screen in the monitoring room or wherever it was.I felt like I kind of lost sight of Tobias' character in this book and actually had to substitute his name for Four to remind myself of the tough, tattooed Dauntless trainer that he was.Throughout the entire series I admired Tris for her outstanding bravery, I really did. I thought, &#34;Wow. She is BRAVE.&#34;  Saying that, I'm just going to skip to what really pissed me off about this book: Her death.First of all, WHAT THE ****!! Okay, just had to get that out. Roth is obsessed with killing people!! Oh my goodness! I can't even count the deaths in all the books combined! I mean, she killed so many people it literally stressed me out, and that was before she killed off Tris terribly and pointlessly but we're getting to that.I couldn't understand why she killed so many people. Al, Will, Tris' mom and dad, half the Abnegation, Lynn, Marlene, a little boy in the elevator, Eric, TORI (what was that??? And then to bring in her brother afterwards?! That was awful. I was saying &#34;Oh God&#34; along with Tobias when George showed up all excited to see his sister who Roth killed off for really no reason at all) Fernando (I liked him! Ugh) Edward, Uriah (Why. Just why. He bought light to this semi-depressing series!! And died right after Tris too), Jeanine. Just so many characters dead. Dead dead dead. I was literally applauding anyone who was still alive by the last book. Especially Christina.Now, before I get to Tris I want to talk about Will's death. In my opinion, I think it was made into a bigger deal than it should have. I mean, Will wasn't really a strong, memorable character and it didn't seem like he and Christina had THAT strong of a bond, nor him and Tris. I mean, I can understand some mourning but having nightmare's and being afraid to hold a gun and all just took it a little too far in MY eyes.Okay, now to Tris' death. Three words:What. Was. That.Throughout the ENTIRE SERIES Tris escaped death SO MANY TIMES and always managed to come out of a near death situation triumphant. That was one of things about her that kept me on my toes. I wasn't really surprised when she took Caleb's place, and I was so glad when she resisted the death serum by finding that 'fire' and that will to live. I was like, 'Yeah!!! :D'And then, ta da! Here's David in his little wheelchair and gun. I was like.. oookaay. Why are you here?Tris and David exchange some words which really weren't important and then Tris lunges for the box to type in the code and.... gets shot by David! After escaping execution from Jeanine, jumping from a train when she first joined Dauntless, jumping to the net, Eric almost killing her twice, dodging bullets left to right in all three books and escaping guards. Heroic, brave Tris conquers the impossible death serum only to be killed by freaking David and his bullets.WHAT EVEN. I was psychologically distressed and still am. I am mentally exhausted and want to sleep so that I can forget what I just read. I am so disappointed in Roth. She killed SO MANY characters i guess that it only seemed fitting that she killed Tris too, right? Well at least give her a GOOD ENDING.And why does her mom show up? Hallucination or not. Where's her dad? Does her mom have special powers in the after- life? I couldn't believe how the Tris that I admired and looked up to met her end. NO. NOOO!I loved Tobias but now (and I'm sad to say, I really am) he's just whatever. Yeah go to your house and cut your hair and try to forget everything when Christina magically shows up and stops you from taking that memory serum. Way to go Christina.I feel like her character changed from the first book until now. Not evolved, not grew, but simply changed and not in a good way. Like we lost touch with the witty, mouthy Candor turned Dauntless girl. Maybe it was her grief or whatever. And I don't know why Roth didn't just kill Peter since she saw it fitting to kill all the GOOD CHARACTERS like Uriah and Marlene and so on. He had no purpose except for in Divergent, to add some drama. Other than that he could have zip-lined to Mexico for all I cared. Bye Peter!My main frustration with this book was Tris' unjust ending and my frustration with the series was Veronica killing people from left to right. It IS a thrilling series, don't get me wrong, but this book in particular? No. I think the ending even made some of my hair fall out but I'm not sure. It was just. so. stressful. And no one needed Tris and Tobias arguing like that in the last two books. I mean, I know all couples have their disagreements but if you really get down to the root of Four, he didn't strike me as the type to stand there and argue and chastise over and over again.My last thoughts: Marcus was a prick, Evelyn was unstable and gave in too easily to Tobias when it seemed that she was hell-bent on controlling the city, Nita was a pointless character. And the whole GP and GD and the Fringe was just a big mess.

It took me a while to decide on a rating, but in the end I decided on 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.  If it weren't for the ending, though, this would probably be 3 stars.Okay, so what happened to the amazing writing in Divergent and Insurgent?  Those books were fast-paced, action-packed, and had strong characters.  And I felt like Allegiant was lacking slightly in all those areas.  The pacing was weird, making me occasionally bored with the plot.  There was a fair amount of action, but there was also too much useless, boring dialogue between the characters.  And what happened to the formerly kick-butt Tobias?  While I still liked Tris in Allegiant, Tobias was more wimpy than he was in the previous books.  His POV and Tris's were way too similar.Still, there were definitely moments in Allegiant that I appreciated.  I love the minor characters; they each stand out in their own way.  There are a couple adorable Tris/Tobias scenes.  Mostly, though, I love how Roth writes about relationships.  I love the tension between Tris and her brother, Caleb, and how Tris has to decide the importance of family and how far she'll go to save her family and friends.  I thought their brother/sister bond was written very realistically.  There's quite a few quotes that I loved, too.  Roth writes beautifully about the meaning of bravery and sacrifice.I'm still in shock over the ending.  I disliked it at first, even though it made sense and was very fitting.  But now, I have to say that, as sad as the ending is, I do like it.  I admire Roth for that ending; it took guts to write that.  It's very heartbreaking and actually moved me to tears, but I'm happy with it.  Not every dystopian has to have a happily-ever-after ending, and Roth has proved that.Although Allegiant didn't hold my attention as much as the previous books, I still found it to be a thought-provoking and enjoyable read.

{"reviewTime": "10 24, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I finished this last night and afterwards I felt just dead inside. I absolutely hate when a series ends leaving me feeling unsatisfied and even, in this case, angry. I feel kind of betrayed by the author.I loved Divergent. The book had its faults, but I really fell in love with the whole story, the characters, the romance between Tris and Four, the Factions, etc. I read and re-read Divergent probably 8-10 times. I bought the audio book version as well. I was SO PSYCHED about the movie! I bought Insurgent and devoured it as well. It didn't have quite the same magic for me that Divergent did, but I still loved it. So I was REALLY psyched to read Allegiant.And maybe my hopes were too high.I don't know.That doesn't change the fact that this book utterly and completely disappointed me.SPOILERS AHEADFor real, SPOILERS!READ AT YOUR OWN RISK![**What's outside the fence?**I was really excited, after reading the 'cliffhanger' ending to Insurgent, to find out what was outside the fence. I had my theories, and I was right about some, wrong about others. I was expecting the cameras and Truman Show-esque thing, but I was not expecting all the genetic manipulation crap. As soon as our heroes get outside the fence, there are chapters and chapters of info dumping and, to be honest, it's kind of dull. We learn that Chicago (and some other cities) were created as 'experiments' because of genetic manipulation gone wrong. Supposedly these cities were an attempt at creating more 'genetically pure' people (aka Divergents). This is so far-fetched and bizarre, but I was willing to go along with it.**Tris and Four**I wasn't against the dual perspective, though once I finished the book I realized why she HAD to write it in a dual perspective. However, I don't think it was done well. There were several times where I would get halfway through a chapter and not remember who I was in the head of at the time, mostly because the two narrators had identical voices.Tris has always been an interesting character to me. I really liked that she was tough, but a little vulnerable and naive. I liked her progression through Divergent and Insurgent. She doesn't really progress much here. We've always known Tris is a selfless person who is more than willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good, or for her loved ones. That doesn't change here. More on that later. She does become kind of arrogant and holier-than-thou here, and it really started to bug me. She's 16, but she often acts (and everyone treats) her like a grown-up. She is pretty much always right in Allegiant and she makes sure everyone knows it.Four was awesome in Divergent. He loses all of that awesomeness in Allegiant. He becomes quite whiny and pathetic to the point where I actually wanted Tris to break up with him. She probably should have, considering some of the stupid and completely out of character stuff he does. I really hated seeing him reduced to this quivering mess of a boy who does nothing but wax poetic about his mommy and daddy issues. Four was always strong, and he is the polar opposite of that here.I did enjoy the progression of their relationship though. Some people have complained about the scene where Four accuses Tris of being jealous, but I actually liked it. I like that they, FOR ONCE, acted like TEENAGERS. Unfortunately that was a tiny part of this book, and for the rest of it they act like 30-40 year old worldly adults.**THE END OF THE CONFLICT**So we have Four's mother Evelyn running Chicago like a factionless tyrannical dictatorship. Johanna and Marcus running the Allegiant, trying to reinstate the factions.Evelyn has been portrayed as a nearly heartless person, hell bent on making all the Factioned people clean toilets like the Factionless had to do for so many years. At the height of the conflict, she is willing to allow a &#34;Death Serum&#34; to kill pretty much everyone in Chicago in order to avoid going back to the Factions. This is when Four arrives and says &#34;Hey Mom, I'll be your son again if you stop acting like a monster&#34; and she goes &#34;Okay.&#34;She then negotiates with Marcus and Johanna. Marcus wants to take over as evil dictator and Johanna says &#34;Nah, you're not gonna do that&#34; and Marcus just says &#34;Okay.&#34;Conflict over.WHAT?WHAT????????????**Mass Murder**Roth has not shied away from killing off characters in the first two books, but I felt like most of that had a purpose. Tris' parents in the first book, Al (due to the guilt over his own actions towards Tris), Jeannine in Insurgent, and more. Deaths in Allegiant come just as rapidly and have even less meaning. Tori dies in a very sudden manner, and then is mostly forgotten about. She was referred to as the leader of the Dauntless, but she is killed and then is nothing more than an afterthought for the rest of the book.Uriah's death is given a lot more page time, but only as a way to make Four feel like total garbage for getting involved in the rebellion and to make Tris &#34;right&#34; once again.The biggest death of all was Tris, and this was the biggest disappointment to me. I will be straight up honest - I LIKE a happy ending. I read YA because I like knowing that things will most likely end up happy overall. I read romance because I know there will always be a happily ever after. HOWEVER, I can deal with a bittersweet ending so long as it feels satisfying and feels like closure.Tris' death was NOT that ending.Caleb's betrayal was a huge part of Insurgent, and that continues on in Allegiant. He has a LOT to atone for in Allegiant and when he volunteers for the suicide mission to help save everyone, he does it because he wants Tris to forgive him. And he doesn't want to live with the guilt of what he did. Instead of letting him, Tris forces him to let her go instead. I understand this. Tris forgave him and doesn't want him to die because he feels guilty. I get it.HOWEVERCaleb doesn't get that opportunity to redeem himself. While I understand that Tris acted the way she had to act, that doesn't mean Caleb can't take a bullet for her. That doesn't mean he can't force a redemption. Instead, Tris dies in a completely unsatisfying scene that left me going &#34;WHAT THE HECK JUST HAPPENED?&#34; Caleb lives and basically still is the coward and traitor.Caleb NEEDED to redeem himself. He needed to take that bullet for Tris and die.Instead, we get this messed up ending where Caleb lives. Peter lives (gets his mind erased BY HIS OWN CHOICE and gets to start over). Marcus lives (just disappears somehow). David (Tris' murderer) lives (also gets his mind erased and even though he's an evil murderer, no one cares because he doesn't remember). Almost all the bad guys live and get to have perfectly happy, normal lives.This is NOT SATISFYING.THIS IS POINTLESS.Sorry, but this book was awful. I wanted to love it. I REALLY wanted to love it. I was willing to deal with all the weird genetically damaged stuff. I was willing to deal with the complete dismantling of Four's character. I was willing to deal with a lot, but Tris' pointless and needless death... NOPE. This death felt like it was here for shock value only. So the author could be &#34;edgy&#34; and &#34;different.&#34;Unfortunately, all she did for me is ruin the entire series. I won't be re-reading Divergent or Insurgent anymore.

In Allegiant, Roth tries to tell the story in first person part of the time. She switches off between Tris and Tobias, one chapter will be Tris---the next Tobias.  This makes the flow of the story very hard to follow at times.  Also, while I believe Roth's intent was to give us an opportunity to get in touch with the feelings of these two character, I believe the first person style has the opposite effect.  The characters, especially Tris, suddenly seem to be whiny little seventh graders instead of strong, self-assured leaders of Dauntless.  The plot was decent, although it was difficult to follow at times because of the switching back and forth between Tris and Tobias.  And the ending----don't even get me started on that!!

It really didn't go in the direction I thought it would. It definitely stopped reminding me of The Hunger Games, except in that I was left not really liking or completely hating the conclusion of this series, just like I did with the conclusion of The Hunger Games.I guess what I liked about the final chapter of this series is that the overall message of the series is that despite our differences, people are people, and there is no success in trying to get them to conform to a linear way of life. Life is constantly evolving and when you try to stop that natural progression, evolution will always find a way. I also liked the fact that with each of the books Tris' growth was in the forefront. There is no doubt she was meant to be the hero of this series. Her lack of self-preservation and unbounded courage is something to aspire to, albeit maybe not so recklessly.Now for what I didn't like. I really didn't like the whole &#34;genetic damage v. genetic pure&#34; debate that is all too prevalent in Allegiant. I know this is a fictional story but I couldn't help feeling angry because no matter how you slice it, it is a discriminatory concept. When I got to this point in the book, I finally understood why so many people were not happy with Allegiant. I also didn't like the almost dictatorship-like political hierarchy &#34;The Bureau&#34; had over everyone's lives. This whole &#34;serum&#34; business and unnecessary elimination of life was annoying aggravating.So I guess the best way to summarize how I felt about Allegiant, on its own, is to say that I hated to like it.

I am usually very careful about looking for those words before reading a review. This time I was not so lucky. So... (SPOILER ALERT!) I knew that Tris did not survive before I started reading the book. That being said, this is an example of \"It is not the destination, but the journey that matters.\" The journey in this case was for the most part worth it. I did have a hard time remembering some key characters from the two previous novels. Maybe I should have re- read them, but I did not have time. I think Roth should have somehow reminded the readers where characters such as Christina came in. I also felt like Four's character was not parallel to the one in the previous novels. He was too weak. It was as if he was a different person. However, this is a great example of a dystopia novel where the idea of a \"perfect\" society is thwarted by the reality of how humans react. The idea of separating \"genetically perfect\" people from those deemed \"genetically damaged\" is horrible, especially when the government justifies it as a necessity for human survival.

I was not expecting this kind of book for the finale of such an action packed dystopian series.For me, the first 3/4 of the book was slow. I don&#8217;t always mind a slow pace, but I do mind when the first 2 books are so intense. At the beginning there was a lot of learning about the world which was cool but didn&#8217;t keep my interest. It made me think Roth had planned the first 2 books, but then had to make up unrelated stuff for the last book. It&#8217;s all about expectations sometimes, sad but true.Like I said, it took awhile but when things really started going it was definitely entertaining. Tris was still a fierce but tender character full of despair but love as well. Tobias struggled, and I didn&#8217;t like him for a few chapters. But then I realized he&#8217;s human with ups and downs that he learned from. I didn&#8217;t think he reacted like the Four we knew, but I guess the guy was allowed to change when living such a hard life. I learned from these two main characters about life and love. I actually highlighted quotes in my Kindle which I rarely do.The ups and downs in their relationship made me not care if they stayed together. Some of their ups felt unnatural after their downs. I felt blah and confused about their relationship.If you read the first two books in the Divergent series then you HAVE to read Allegiant to find out how their story ends. If this book is made into a movie I think it will be really entertaining.

{"reviewTime": "12 2, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "There are a lot of detailed reviews out there, and I don't want to be overly repetitive. My biggest gripes are actually not the phenomenal fail of an ending, but more structural issues throughout.First, like many others, I *LOVED* Divergent. And Insurgent was one I devoured but didn't love as much. But Allegiant was a complete and total disappointment.As many have said, it was nearly impossible to tell Tris and Tobias apart. Doesn't help that their names are so close visually, so a cursory glance at the chapter title doesn't suffice--you have to really look, and then keep reminding yourself through each chapter. But I do not remember this being an issue before. So....what happened????The science. I have a college degree in biology. Not a PhD, but I do have a BS and my favorite topic of study was genetics. What it boils down to is this:You cannot regain &#34;genetic purity&#34; by putting a  bunch of &#34;genetically damaged&#34; people in isolation and encourage them to interbreed. Oh, wait--they don't even really encourage it. You see, the factions are so bent on staying pure to themselves, most people stay within their faction and breed among the same population of people with the same genetic damage. It might be different if the law were that you HAD to CHANGE factions and breed with other factions.But really, the best thing would be to let those people breed with the &#34;pure&#34; population and water down the &#34;bad&#34; genes.Or, as others have mentioned, if this society has the tech to extract genes from humans, they have the tech to insert them, too. Also, most scientists these days ALREADY KNOW that genes very rarely work in isolation, so they would have known extracting genes for one thing would affect other things.Anyway, my science background is getting in the way here. So let's talk story.Again, the voice was an issue. Also, the character reactions were inconsistent. Places where there should have been MAJOR conflict, or at least inner conflict, were glossed over, and other places where the characters should have been more logical they got all emotional.Plot: No. Just no. None of it made any sense to me. The serums for everything, the way these people go about it all, the explosions. No, these people have access, and are hacker types and scientist types and they would have been much more sneaky and would have USED THE SERUMS THEY HAD on the guards and David in private and there would have been no death from explosions. Not to mention the timing of everything. The moment Tris or Tobias learned of a plan, it was immediately implemented.The pacing was all wrong, too. Long stretches of theological-disguised-as-sociological discussion broken up with bits of violence and/or kissing. I won't get much into the Christian message of this book, but it doesn't work. I'm a Christian, and I felt preached at through the whole thing, although there were times when I wasn't entirely sure *what* was being preached.Let me finish this off by saying this: I feel awful writing this review.

I could NOT wait to get my hands on the final installment of the series and pre-ordered it from Amazon. The book continues to fall Tris and Tobias (AKA Four, man of my dreams) on their quest for freedom and truth in the dystopian society they live in.In Allegiant, the factions have been dissolved, but the citizens of Chicago now find themselves slaves to a new tyrant who enforces their &#34;freedom&#34;, Tobias' own mother Evelyn. Tobias, Tris, and their friends make their way out of the city to find a surprising new world where they finally learn a truth that will change everything they believe.So what do I love so much about this book? So many things. Seriously.1. Tris and Tobias. There is no love triangle in this series. Praise God. They have a solid relationship that faces challenges other than a third person getting in the way.... Instead they have to deal with lying, trust issues, and forgiveness. A lot of this stems from Tris' previous errors in the relationship. &#34;Remember when I teamed up with your abusive father to basically end the world as we know it?&#34; You know, the usual.  However, Tobias brings his own challenges in this book which makes it clear that they have an equal and truly loving relationship.2. The point of view.  Unlike the first two books which were told solely from Tris' perspective, Allegiant alternates between Tris and Tobias. This switch adds another dimension to the story-telling, and makes the resolution much more poignant.3. Action.  There are some great action scenes that do not drag on or distract from the story line... instead they add to the storytelling and allow us to see the true nature of our heroes.4. SPOILER. BIGGEST SPOILER EVER. DO NOT READ THIS SECTION. DANGER, DANGER WILL ROBINSON!!!!!Are you still reading? Take a breath. Tris dies. YES. I really admire Roth's bravery in killing off the main hero that we have rooted for over the course of three books. Honestly, it seemed like the only fitting ending. Tris finds in herself the courage to face death, even when she has so much to live for, to protect all the people that she loves. Even those that may not deserve it. She is innately good, despite the society that has tried to turn her into something else.  It turns out that she has more Abnegation in her than she maybe even thought. The last several chapters are told only from Tobias' viewpoint, which is especially touching.Overall, Allegiant is a beautiful, fast reading story of friendship, love, and redemption.... with a little dystopian drama thrown in for good measure.

Tris, if there was no other choice, if it would have added to the quality of the character, the society, or have been in any way at all necessary, I would have been okay with her fate.

I felt like I was reading a different book. Peter's story line was the only one that even remotely made sense. I LOVED the first two books in this series.

You can see my review for the first and second book on my blog (KDH Reviews).First, let's talk about the point of view of this book. The first two books are told exclusively from Tris's point of view. This book, however, is told from the POV of both Tris and Four. In general, I like seeing a story from multiple points of view, but not always. This is one of those cases. I didn't like the switch up. I would have preferred sticking to one point of view.Let's discuss the good parts of the book. One, we get answers. We learn about the city and what's happened in the world. These are answers we've been waiting for since the beginning of the trilogy. Second, I enjoyed the ending. Allegiant has an ending that's polarizing. Some people will love it and some people will hate it. After everything that's happened, I liked it. It was fitting.Now, let's get on with the not so good parts. One, this book moved so incredibly slow. Compared to the first two books, Allegiant moves at a snail's pace. It bordered on boring, if I'm completely honest. Two, this book kind of left the entire trilogy feeling mediocre to me.Overall, I don't really know why there's so much hype surrounding this trilogy. Yeah, it's good, but it's *not* that good. I expected more and am left feeling disappointed.

Before I managed to finish this book I knew that there was some controversy about it and I know there are plenty of people unsatisfied with what happened. Though I have to say this book ripped my heart out and made me cry more than I'd like to admit, I still can't see the sense in disliking it because of that.I absolutely loved the first book of this series, Divergent, and didn't like Insurgent as much as that. I think that I like this third book more than I liked the second one. It was just so much more interesting to me and I loved not knowing what would happen next. I can't say anything specific without giving away spoilers but be satisfied knowing that there are very cute scenes and scenes filled with action and suspense.That said, I didn't get the same heart-pounding feel I had through most of Divergent until I got to maybe the last third of the book. But I loved the pacing in this, even though some scenes felt very unnecessary. I liked being able to see more of the characters from other books in calmer settings, not just when they're about to get killed. The theme of forgiveness that was strong in the first two books makes its return here in new but equally heartbreaking ways.I did like hearing from both Tris and Four in this book. However, I didn't like how similar their voices were. I'd often find myself reading and thinking that it was one of them, only to find out that the character I thought was speaking was somewhere else in the room. That made me backtrack a few times and tended to be annoying. I just wish that they'd had more unique voices.If you haven't read Allegiant yet, go and pick it up now!

{"reviewTime": "11 9, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Even as an adult, I am a fan of young adult fiction because I really enjoy watching how younger minds are being shaped by what they read. This dystopian trend is actually very useful in exposing young minds to the idea that they are powerful and capable of shaping their own worlds. It allows them to explore philosophy, sociology, and political science in a carefully constructed framework. It should, in it's best forms, empower young people to recognize their ability to bring about great change. The Divergent series opened with fantastic potential. And then it failed spectacularly to carry through.While the first two books showed promise from having created an original and interesting culture, this book brings it all to a very unsatisfying resolution. It also brings to focus some of the problems in the earlier books that were easier to overlook amidst all the action.The first book creates a fabulous, unique and interesting microculture. It's beautifully thought out and opens the door to all types of fabulous exploration of that world and how it came to be.I wish there had been subsequent books about the other factions before we went to the eminent collapse story, but we moved straight into that in book two. It was very action-laden and didn't pay enough service to the amazing world Ms. Roth created. So much missed opportunity, but my attention remained riveted, and I really looked forward to book three and it's promise of explanations. However, while explanations of a sort did present themselves, they were threadbare and surrounded by so much teen angst and superficial emotional wallowing that there was little satisfaction to be had.These characters are all, regardless of age, extremely childish and one-dimensional. Their emotional development doesn't even seem to reach adolescence. There is an obsession with forgiveness on a very elementary-school level, written by someone who seems to have struggled with their own issues of forgiveness via a simplistic morality-based philosophy instead of through the eyes of a mature adult who has developed empathy and wisdom. Everyone is a foot-stomping, fit-throwing child who needs to find sacrifice and proper humility in order to grant forgiveness. Long explanations about nonsensical differences between &#34;confession and admission&#34; compounded with flat and uncomplicated descriptions of the personalities of abusive parents reveal an author who has a long way to go in exorcising the demons of her own childhood. And, of course, all of this detracts from any narration that might exist in the story. Our characters spend the majority of the book mad at each other, mad at their families, mad at authority figures, mad at the past, and just mad in general. They are angry young people who spend more time narcissistically struggling with their own anger than dealing with the very real problems surrounding them. Whenever they do get around to DOING anything, it is often just a bunch of reactive flailing with very little thought to consequence. The fact that anything is ever successful seems to be more of an accident than anything else. And, of course, they come out of each experience angry with everyone else involved. Resolution to this anger is painfully immature. Yes, I realize the protagonists are mostly young, but even the adults involved seem to react to the world as if they were 13. Having even one mature mentor might have helped a lot, but I'm not sure Ms. Roth would be capable of writing such a character.I wish we could have moved away from the sophomoric existential struggles of childhood morality and really explored the deeper philosophical potential of this world. The best young adult fiction gives the reader an opportunity to expand their thinking. This one gives them an excuse to continue being mad at mean parents, mean authority figures, meany-meanersons everywhere.

{"reviewTime": "05 29, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "This book is definitely the worst of the divergent trilogy, which is surprising because I was extremely critical of the first one.What makes this book so bad? For me, a major part is a shift in how the story is presented. In the first two books it is entirely from Tris' perspective. You would think after reading two books that do not deviate AT ALL throughout, the third book would follow suit. Not the case at all. For whatever reason Roth decides to jump back and forth between Tobias and Tris. This made the story incredibly hard to follow because after a few pages I would forget the chapter switched to Tobias' narrative and wonder why Tris would say, think, or do something totally out of character. I'd flip back to the beginning of the chapter only to realize it switched again, which removes you entirely from the story. Think of it as watching a DVD and you see an actor you recognize but you cannot for the life of you remember his/her name. You decide to stop the movie and check the credits. A few minutes go by and you forget the name, so you check again. Yeah, it gets annoying really quickly!The cliffhanger at the end of the second novel was simply amazing as the possibilities were literally endless. Anything could have been outside of the city walls. Sadly, the truth was much less exciting than many of the possibilities I dreamed up while waiting to read the third book. Roth should have spent more time developing the world outside. Instead, she went the greed route and put out a book before it was fully ready and hoped fans of the earlier two would come flocking to read it. Sadly I fell for it, but I do feel better knowing I borrowed the book from a library and can give it back.

It was well written and I still enjoy Roth's writing style, however the story itself was a disappointment.The story switches between Tris's and Tobias's point of view.  Tris is languishing in lockdown after releasing information that Tobias's mother (and leader of the Factionless) didn't want released.  Tobias is walking a fine line; he doesn't really support what his mother is doing but wants to be in the know and wants her to trust him.  Tobias also wants Tris released.  Then both characters learn about a faction called Allegiant which is against what the Factionless are doing.  When Tris and Tobias get involved with the Allegiant they are asked to travel beyond the fence and see what's out there.  Both of them hope that beyond the fence will be a better place where they can start anew.It honestly took me a while to figure out what I thought about this book.  There are certain things that happen at the end that will piss off the reader big time.  So I had to take some time and think the book through in order not to just have the \"Oh, my God I hate this book\" reaction.  In the end I realized that there were a lot of things...not just the ending...that I was disappointed about.I think a lot of these dystopian trilogies suffer from poor endings.  I mean really, the first book is the big reveal of a cool new world and neat ideas.  The second book is further development of those ideas.  The third book has to resolve stuff, and that's tough when honestly the resolution is usually a bit convoluted and boring.  I mean ultimately you are looking at replacing a corrupt system with a better one...and that's not all that exciting or easy to do in an entertaining way.  I can't think of one dystopian series I have read where the final book in the series is better than the earlier books.I did like that Tris and Tobias actually tried to work through their relationship problems.  However, even this got a bit old...they have the same problems over and over again.  The chemistry between these two seems to have cooled off some in this book.The book is very readable and well written, I am not sure I liked how convoluted the story got.  I was a kind of disappointed when Tris and Tobias get out of the city and find very similar problems to what they faced in the city.  There are multiple factions outside the city and people are not being treated fairly.  The outside was just an echo of the inside of the city (or visa versa).  The addition of more and more different factions just got old...and to be honest boring.  No surprises, nothing all that interesting or groundshaking.  I was having trouble staying awake as I read this book.This is a long book...I feel like a lot of what is in here was unnecessary and just added complication.  The whole thing ends up being a war between Tobias's dad and Tobias's mom...which is kind of dumb and disappointing.  Not to mention the vast number of coincidences that happen in this story to lead the reader to that point.  It just came of as convoluted and contrived.Also, while I understand the ending of the book and why it was possibly the most realistic path forward, I also think it wouldn't have killed Roth to write an ending that was just a little bit more happy.  It would have been nice to give the reader a bit more hope that things in this world were going to go the right way in the end.  As mentioned above this is part of why I am getting sick of dystopia...they never end all that happy.Overall definitely the weakest book of the trilogy.  I still enjoy Roth's writing style but I thought that what Tobias and Tris found Outside was disappointing, boring, and just added complication that didn't need to be there.  I didn't enjoy the addition of yet more groups and factions and the fact that the whole thing ended up being more of a war between Tobias's parents than anything else.  I also didn't like the ending, although I understand how it fit the story well.  I really wasn't a fan of this book, it felt more like a necessary evil I had to read to finish this series than anything else.All that being said, the first two books in this series were absolutely excellent.

I feel like he always asked her to feel out a situation, then didnt respect her opinion, and justified it (in both cases) that she didnt like the person (and in  1 case of being jealous).

{"reviewTime": "12 3, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Explanation:Allegiant opens with the discontent people of Chicago hoping to make a stand against the Factionless. The discontent, become the Allegiant, a small group revolting against Evelyn Johnson, the new leader. The Allegiant want to find answers and resolve order to the city of Chicago. Tobias, Tris and their friends are chosen to go where no one else has gone before, outside the city limits into the world beyond. In leaving the city they enter a society they know nothing about.  Here they learn the truth about their home, and must decide what to do with this knowledge. The Allegiant have two choices- to assist the citizens of this strange new world and walk away from the only home they have known or to fight for the people they have left behind.Opinion:Every once in a while a book comes along that is so different, exhilarating and refreshing that it takes your breath away- Allegiant is one of those books! Veronica Roth elevated Allegiant from what could have potentially been a mediocre read to an EPIC novel, by creating a diverse and unpredictable plot. How do you make a book truly EPIC? You leave the reader reeling, with the most unsatisfied taste in their mouth after turning the last page! This feeling makes the reader ponder what could have been, long after the book was completed.When I first began reading this book I did find it a bit &#8216;ho-hum&#8217;. It took me a week to get halfway through and I really wasn&#8217;t interested in getting to the end because I thought I knew exactly what was coming- oh how wrong I was! I think my reluctance to read the book too quickly was also because I didn&#8217;t like some of the earlier revelations in the book, and I didn&#8217;t want to know how anything else could damage these characters.  I preserved though and all I can say is wow, Veronica Roth, WOW!Roth also did not do the one thing that turned Stephanie Meyer&#8217;s Twilight Series into a mediocre read. She did not close every loose end up by the conclusion of the book. Now I am a fan of stories being completed properly, and I hate movies that leave you guessing. But Roth created her story without its neatly packed endings, which elevates this book to the beyond impressive level.The dual perspective writing also gave more insight into both Tris and Tobias&#8216;s thoughts and feelings. The previous two books in the Divergent Series are told only from Tris&#8217;s point of view. That sufficed for those books, but Allegiant very much needed the two viewpoints in order for the reader to understand the whole story. Tobias&#8217;s point of view allowed the reader to see how deeply he cared for Tris and how much his parents have impacted upon his life choices. Tris&#8217;s chapters were written in the same strong, determined and selfless voice of the heroine we know and love.Summary:Allegiant could have been just another nice, teen book series where the heroine always gets what they want.

I think a lot of the negative reviews are because it wasn't all wrapped up at the end in the fairy tale package like most YA trilogies have been.  This was more real.  I admit it made me cry in parts (I won't spoil it with what parts), but I think it was supposed to make you feel what they were feeling.Someone said in one of the reviews that Peter never showed remorse for his actions in the other books then he does in this one--did they not read Insurgent--Peter is the one who saved Tris from death at the hands of Jeanine then when the factionless took over, he stayed near his mother and didn't participate--he was already hating himself then.  He was never meant to be a good guy, but he always knew he should try to be better--he just never could put forth the effort to do good instead of evil.No book is perfect, so I think the criticism of this one has been a bit harsh, but I still liked it.  It did remind me of the Matched trilogy in the memory erasure, but all these YA dystopian novels have similarities.  At least there was no love triangle in this one--Tris and Four loved only each other--I still refuse to call him Tobias.  Now I get to wait to see how they destroy the novels for the movies...hate to see the amazon reviews when they release the movies.", "reviewerName": "K.

I know there are a number of people really angry about this book and I just have to disagree with them. I loved it and I love this series. I know some of it can seem to drag on about technology and the history behind this city but I felt like I learned the most about their past and present in Allegiant than any other book. We settled a lot different plot lines in these pages plus had quite the number of surprises along the way. If you don't want to be spoiled I would stop reading right now.Tris had to die. I'm sorry but it's the truth. This conflict was never going to end with her being alive and moving on. She became the hero we all thought she was all along by saving everyone but losing her own life. I thought the author took a major risk doing this to main character but it was the risk worth taking in a series that has been unique as this. Tris went out in a blaze of glory while saving the people that she loved and it felt right. This wasn't the happily ever after that we all want for our beloved character but it was the right ending. The only complaint I had with Allegiant was the narration. We spent two other books in Tris' head and didn't need Fours. I would actually rather have seen the entire book played out in her own head and when she dies have Four narrate the rest. That would have been a much better transition for me to hear. It would have played out much like the novellas that have been interwoven into the series along the way rather than introduce this new perspective in the last book. It seemed strange and awkward but I understood why we needed his eyes at the end.

{"reviewTime": "01 16, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "And the series is over.Divergent is a pulse pounding, violent chase through a dystopian society. Insurgent is more emotional, allies and foes and lies and love. In Allegiant, Roth tries to wind everything up into an explosive finale. And she does a pretty decent job of it.Honestly, while Divergent slapped me in the face, pulled my hair, and screamed &#8220;Read one more chapter!&#8221;, Insurgent felt slower. Although I feel like there was a lot of emotional storytelling in the middle book, all of the backstabbing and lies felt a little to much for me. And Tris got on my nerves. Now in Allegiant, Tris and Four are trying to find a new path together, one filled with honesty and love and truth. And you know, save their world at the same time.Allegiant introduces us to the world outside of their city, and a new cast of characters. I don&#8217;t want to give too much away, so all I&#8217;ll say is that I loved this idea. The whole thing. It&#8217;s creepy enough for it to be real. Roth does a good job at trying to explain the origin of their city, the fractions, and the divergent history. The third book asks a lot of new questions and there&#8217;s a lot of truth that are now shown as lies.  I really liked the questions that were posed, how vulnerable Four and Tris are, in their own ways. How two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right.Tris and Four each handle these things very differently and it&#8217;s great to see how their relationship strains and stretches under the stress. Their problems are based on real issues many couples have- trust, strength, identity. The real issues between Tris and Four make the book believable and real, bringing the reader back to a place of emotion. It&#8217;s easy to get lost in the new dystopian world.At the beginning of the book, there is one death in particular that I think is supposed to be shocking. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t moved. I think because Allegiant dives right in, being the third book and all, and it&#8217;s been a while since I read book two, the deaths weren&#8217;t as emotionally jarring to me at the beginning. I barely remember some of these secondary characters. That said, the death does do one thing really well- it fills the reader with a sense of dread quickly and soon, you&#8217;re running and jumping and dodging bullets with Tris and Four. You&#8217;re there. With them.I did feel like there was something missing in this final installment, but I can&#8217;t place my finger on it. Maybe it&#8217;s the introduction of so many new characters, a new setting, new truths that don&#8217;t have time to be explored. The ending and actions did feel rushed, out of sequence sometimes, reactions and split decisions that weren&#8217;t backed up with enough information for me to honestly believe that this was the only choice the characters had to make. The justifications weren&#8217;t always there and I found myself yelling at them to slow down, don&#8217;t trust them, get more information.And the ending. I was surprised at first, but then, after thinking about it, no. The ending is the way it should be.While Allegiant isn&#8217;t my favorite in the series, it is a solid ending, bringing together closure for the characters and a hopeful path ahead.", "reviewerName": "Kimberly C \"The Windy Pages\"", "summary": "An ending falling short, but still a great series.", "helpful": [2, 4], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1389830400, "reviewerID": "AOLRFN1T5BCGE"}

I now wish I hadn't wasted my time.

But it's apparent that for reasons I'll never understand, she decided to write this mess. The dialog is stilted, Roth isn't good writing from different perspectives other than Tris', the characters never really developed and it seems like Roth didn't know what to do with some of the supporting characters so she either kills them off or they just sort of faded away and became irrelevant.And what happened to Four between the time she wrote Insurgent and Allegiant??? Did she suddenly start to hate him? I never liked that his daddy and mommy issues weren't resolved during the first two books but they really make a difference in his thinking in Allegiant. Four used to be badass but in Allegiant, he became this whiney, angst filled, insecure boy/man whose parents didn't hug him enough. Sadly, his character devolved over time.I love Tris. I'll always love Tris. I think Roth knows her best so if this is what she wanted to do to her beloved character, then it's her choice. But I think Tris' relationship with Four, despite the fact that she thinks she's in love with him, just seemed too contrived and maybe Roth couldn't write it any other way.

Not only that, but its not even a good romance.Third, this book alternates between Tobias and Tris's perspectives.  It turns out that those two have the same narration.  If it weren't for the title at the beginning of the chapter and talking about the other person, you wouldn't know who the narrator was.Lastly, this book left plot holes everywhere.  I'm okay with some and I can live with issues, but so many clear issues are annoying.As others have mentioned, I think Veronica Roth had a responsibility to her readers but she did not live up.  What a bummer! But like many of you, I had invested myself into the other two books and decided that I just needed to know how it turned out.

I would have rather waited two more years for this book to come out, had I felt like it would end in a way that fit in better with the first two books.  Everything about this felt like it wasn't completely thought out, and a lot of what happened did not make sense for the characters.For example (SPOILER ALERT):Did anyone really think, for one second, that Tris would let Caleb sacrifice himself? Therefore, why would Tobias think that she would? He knew her well enough to know that that would have NEVER happened.  Yet, he went back into the city without a question and left her in the compound to \"save the world\".Tobias is also not one to trust very easily, so why would he have so quickly trusted Nita?There was this crazy buildup of Evelyn as this evil leader, and all it took to get her to stop was Tobias making her choose between him and the war.  That was way too easy!Did Uriah's death add anything to the book, other than causing Tobias to have to go back to the city to tell Zeke and his mother? I think that his death definitely made Tobias feel worse about working with Nita, but I think he felt bad enough before finding out about Uriah.  He made a mistake and Tris always had to be right about everything.  I would have liked to see Tobias be right about something, for once.  I really wanted Tris and Tobias to work together equally.  I felt like Veronica was leading up to them finally working together and having an equal trust of each other in their relationship, but then Tris had her plan with the memory serum and no one else's opinion mattered.When Tris died, it was like she wasn't even trying to stay alive.  She just accepted it.  When in Insurgent, on her way to be given the death serum, she realized how much she wanted to live.  I don't think it was necessary to kill Tris.  I honestly don't think it added to the story in any way.  If anything, it makes me not want to recommend this trilogy to people anymore.  Tris was a survivor.  She would have fought a lot harder to live.Overall, I did love this trilogy.  I would have liked it to have ended differently, and I would have liked Veronica Roth to have had a little more time to think through the rushed ending, but I'm still happy I read the book and finished the trilogy.

{"reviewTime": "10 26, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "If I could give this book 10 stars I would.This is a very hard book for me to review.  I want to do it justice, and I hope I can.Veronica Roth's dystopian trilogy continues with ALLEGIANT. In both DIVERGENT and INSURGENT Tris narrates the novel from her point of view. This time around, Tris and Tobias alternate the narration. The reason this becomes necessary is made clear near the end of the book.SPOILER ALERT: THE REST OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.This book was un-put-down-able.  There were times when I wanted to throw the book across the room. (I refrained because I was reading it on my e-reader.) I had to take a break a few times after an intense scene, but I couldn't stay away from the story for long. The plot flow was logical and the characters' reasoning for doing things was explained well.Both Tris and Tobias are guarded individuals, and it shows in their thoughts and speech. There is not a lot of elaboration; they say what needs to be said and give you the information you need to know and not much more. This is consistent with growing up in their Abnegation faction.  Self-sacrifice and not drawing attention to yourself, in speech or in dress, are attributes of the Abnegation. They both chose Dauntless in the choosing ceremony and their actions are in line with this choice. Both Tris and Tobias are constantly on high-alert and actively looking for danger at every turn. They have witnessed and participated in too much death and destruction to be trusting of anyone or anything.I cannot separate the themes in this book from my own Christian perspective, so I will make no attempt to do so. Through the creation of factions, uprisings, brain washing and memory altering, those in charge of the city or the \"experiment\" are constantly trying to re-mold human nature to fit their ideal. Ms. Roth demonstrates time and again that no amount of behavior modification, serums, or slaughter of the genetically damaged can change or repair human nature. Their feeble  attempts to eradicate \"sin\" fail every time. Instead of looking outside themselves, to the God who can redeem them, they try to change themselves on the inside. Only those characters who realize the futility of this, and learn to love one another in spite of their faults and forgive each other find true peace.While the ending did hurt, it did not ruin the story for me. Tris is consistent in her selfless nature and her death is not without meaning. She accomplished her goal to stop the Bureau from destroying the \"Chicago Experiment\" and showed forgiveness to her brother by her agape love. I am reminded of what the old Amity woman in INSURGENT told Tris. \"It isn't about you. It is a gift. You cannot earn it or it ceases to be a gift.\" She believes that she can be forgiven and gladly goes with her mother.Although there is a lot of tragedy, I find the ending hopeful. Tobias ultimately overcomes his fear of the zip line and honors Tris's memory.  Tobias is the more \"damaged\" of the two, but even he realizes there is reason for hope.

I spent most of the time wanting to throw my Kindle out the window.Yeah... not good. I waited over two years for an epic conclusion to this series and instead I feel I was shortchanged. I went into this book thinking it would be non-stop action and all-around badassery. I didn't get that at all. Instead, I suffered through a ridiculously hole-ridden plot that barely made sense. The question I asked myself for the first 40% of this book was, &#34;Sooooo, what was the point of the first two books then?&#34;In Divergent, I absolutely LOVED both Tris and Four. Insurgent had me pissed off at Tris for the majority of the book. Allegiant made me want to punch Tobias/Four for the first 70% and I completely blame Veronica Roth for that. She almost re-wrote his character and turned him into a douchebag and it didn't work for me. I'm trying to figure out if it was to add angst or drama in an otherwise lacking plot.Oh! The &#34;plot&#34;... I. Don't. Get. It. At all. The end of Insurgent was such a cliffhanger and it seemed like Allegiant would pick up right where it ended and we'd be shown complete and utter turmoil. Sorry, to disappoint you, but that's not going to happen. We get a lot of nothing and lame explanations for WHY the factions are in place... genetics, perfection, blah blah blah.For the first 30% I was scratching my head and repeating, &#34;WTF?&#34; in between bouts of fighting sleep. NOTE: I finished the first two books in this series in less than a day. This one took me THREE DAYS to get through. There were many times I wanted to give up because it felt like the book was either:a) Never going to end.orb) Have absolutely no conclusion whatsoever.And oh how I wish I had DNF'd this one! Or maybe I wish I had come across the ending spoiler because I'd have known I was wasting my time. But I gave Roth the benefit of the doubt and stuck it out. I had no idea she'd piss me off and make me despise the series.Some of the secondary characters add absolutely no value to the story. It feels like they're there &#34;just because&#34;.Christina, Uriah, Peter... POINTLESS. Even in the end, they have no major role they played in this contrived disaster. And then there's Evelyn. Once again, Veronica Roth fails. Someone as power hungry and controlling as this woman cannot change who she is in a split second decision. Except in fiction. This all happens at the end, when all the &#34;BIG&#34; things are finally happening. Which, btw, isn't any major battle. It feels like a lesson in church or a moral message that we're supposed to appreciate and find comfort in. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK! I am bummed to think that Roth sold out and went for shock value instead of an ending that made sense. I cannot support such a ridiculous decision or rate this book high because I liked the prior books. It's an all-around mess and instead of saving it with a great ending, Roth went in the wrong direction.The good about this book? One line stands out the most for me.&#34;I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.&#34;Honestly, it blows my mind that *THIS* book was published with *THIS* ending... who decided this was a good idea and that it was the only way it would work?

{"reviewTime": "11 15, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Many people have decried about the ending, but that&#8217;s not even half of what makes this book a total and complete fail.Early on, when they announced Allegiant would be written from both Tris and Tobias&#8217;s point of views (POVs) I was cautiously excited. I really looked forward to getting to know Tobias better (by seeing things through his mind&#8217;s filter). And then I read it&#8230;utterly disappointing.Did an editor even look at this manuscript before it went to press? Tris and Tobias think and process the SAME exact way. This is nothing short of poor and amateur writing abilities on display. Doing the two POV&#8217;s exposed Roth&#8217;s weaknesses as a writer&#8212;she could only write one character moderately well. All others were cardboard. No two people think and process the same on earth. A good writer makes it so that the POV &#8216;voices&#8217; are so different that a reader can open a book to any page, remove name references, and STILL know who&#8217;s head we&#8217;re in.  Roth failed to do this and this is the ultimate failing of the book.Okay&#8230;and for her next book, can someone please help her brainstorm so every plot twist isn&#8217;t either solved or thicken by the introduction of a new serum. Seriously. It was like: Ahhh&#8230;the world is ending! I know. Oh let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s ANOTHER serum that gives people longer life and ANOTHER serum that heals wounds and ANOTHER serum that makes mean people smile and ANOTHER serum that tames unicorns and ANOTHER serum that&#8230;you get my point.Also, can someone please give the author some romance lessons? I mean&#8230;I guess romance in her eyes is &#8220;let&#8217;s fight and be mad and OH! let&#8217;s make out for a chapter, but now I&#8217;m mad again, but let&#8217;s find some place to make-out.&#8221; If that&#8217;s considered good romantic tension these days it&#8217;s no wonder the divorce rates are rising. But really, again, it just exposed shoddy writing. Roth can&#8217;t figure out how to create genuine romantic tension for her characters. Period.And the ending. Yes. We can&#8217;t ignore that (unfortunately, because I&#8217;d sure like to). Honestly, Roth&#8217;s characterization was so weak in this third book (because of the POV failure) that I didn&#8217;t even care by the time I got to the last couple chapters. That being said&#8212;I&#8217;m not entirely opposed to killing off characters (I&#8217;ve done so in my own books), but how Roth did it was wrong and ruined the entire series.Allegiant and subsequently its author, Veronica Roth (who, for the rest of this will be known as VRoth) failed readers on so many levels, but more than anything it/she failed a generation of teen readers who are looking for a new brand of hope.See, when an author writes a book they can&#8217;t just willy-nilly send it out into the world. They must keep in mind that their words have the power to shape and affect people. An author, especially someone with a huge readership, has a responsibility to their readers. They must offer hope within the pages of their book or it&#8217;s a pointless waste of time for the author and more so, the reader.Author William Faulkner said in his acceptance speech for his Nobel Prize, &#8220;The writer&#8217;s duty is to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.&#8221;Does there have to be an &#8220;and they lived happily ever after&#8221; ending? Absolutely not. Suzanne Collins&#8217;s (author of The Hunger Games series) editor put it best when she said that young adult books don&#8217;t need a happy ending, but in the end, there must be &#8220;a window left open&#8221;&#8212;a way where we can see that the characters we&#8217;ve grown to love can move on from tragedy.There must be hope.Teens today are growing up in a far different world than the one I grew up in (and I&#8217;m not that old). I&#8217;m of the Harry Potter generation. The books of my youth were stories of teens that could rise up and save the world. My generation was the one told that if we go to college and work hard then we&#8217;ll get good jobs and we can accomplish anything. I&#8217;m the generation just in front of today&#8217;s teens&#8212;and the teens of today have watched as the bottom dropped out of my generation&#8217;s lives. Where going to college hasn&#8217;t landed many of my friends a job, instead it has left them drowning in debt. Where many parents are divorced and a significant amount of people I know have watched their family home seized by forecloser.Teens today have grown up watching this all unravel. For all of the aware part of their lives, our country has been at war. Think about that. They don&#8217;t know of an America not at war. Polls show that their vision of success is very different than my teen generation (which is only ten years ago). Today&#8217;s teen sees success not as owning a home, graduating college, having a family, or starting a business, instead the number one measure of success in recent polls showed them wanting to be debt free &#8220;at some point in life.&#8221; That&#8217;s it.Contemporary teens aren&#8217;t looking for books about teens saving the world. They only ask for the small hope of saving their small corner of it. So popular books for this generation are ones that in the end show that in the midst of a messed up world, you can find your own peace/hope, even if it&#8217;s just between you and one other person.Fiction has always been meant to combat the reality of life. VRoth failed us here. She didn&#8217;t show us what could be possible. Instead she smacked us in the face with what is. And we don&#8217;t need that. Because we&#8217;ve all dealt with more than enough loss and hardship and heartbreak. We don&#8217;t need books that repeat what we live every single day, we need books that show us that in the midst of a heartbreak world, we can find our own little pod of happiness/joy. That just because the world we live in is going to pot, doesn&#8217;t mean we have to lose hope.Whatever her purpose, VRoth showed teens with Allegiant one horrible thing: their life, their struggles, their fight for right&#8230;none of it matters in the end. Which leaves teens asking: what&#8217;s the point? If nothing I&#8217;m working for matters&#8230;why try? I know that&#8217;s not the message she meant to send, but when an author is careless with their responsibility to readers, this is the kind of thing that can happen.I&#8217;ll admit I spent a good amount of time reading Amazon reviews for Allegiant in order to see if I was the only one left disillusioned. I wasn&#8217;t. Sadly, I&#8217;m in the majority with the one star reviews.Most of the five star reviews I read were people who applauded VRoth on her bravery in &#8220;giving a realistic ending.&#8221; To this I say: there is a whole genre dedicated to realism. If you want stories that make you feel like someone has stabbed your heart on the last page with no chance for recovery, then feel free to read that genre. But for the ninety-five percent of people that read for enjoyment and escapism, sorry, we want some glimmer of a happy ending. If the Divergent series was meant to belong in the realism genre then it was marketed terribly because right now, all we have are broken promises to readers.Also, even within realism, hope is usually the end game.Take the book The Fault in Our Stars which falls in the realism genre, the teens in the story who fall in love both have terminal cancer. In the end of the book Augustus dies. Why weren&#8217;t readers rioting over that? Because a promise wasn&#8217;t broken&#8212;when they picked up the book they knew they were going to read a story about dying teens so a teen dying at the end of the book was something they were braced for, if not expecting.Even still, The Fault in Our Stars ends with hope. Hazel realizes that although Augustus has died, her love for him doesn&#8217;t have to. Death doesn&#8217;t have to change the definition of relationships. My grandfather, who is deceased, is still my grandfather because I&#8217;m living and can claim him as such.

Ms. Roth's writing has matured and become focused, and I love where the story went and how the world opened up, both literally and atmospherically.

This reminds me of the varied reactions of readers to Mockingjay; you either loved it or you hated it.  Sudden senseless death was part of their world.

I looked forward to it for quite some time, as did many fans of the trilogy. I'd give it three stars for a couple of reasons. I personally think trying to portray the emotion and reaction of people who discover they're all basically lab rats in an experiment is an incredibly challenging subject matter. The disappointing thing for me is how shallow the reactions are from the characters. They seem to nod and absorb the information, or information overload as it were. It's almost a numbness. The airplane ride, the tablets, the computers, the wide, wide world in which they live: it is so nonchalant. There are twists that feel cut off. Sometimes I feel like the book should've been longer, more fleshed out, so we could feel the confusion, the chaos, the shell shock that our characters must have gone through. Instead, they fall right into their roles. It felt rushed. From a generalized standpoint, the plot was believable, but the characters reactions to their surrounding just weren't for me. They grew, the matured, they developed, they forgave, they were human. But, it wasn't the strong finish I had hoped for, and it left me feeling like I wish I'd left off reading after Tris and Four forgave each other. For me the book ended when Tris realized that a mature relationship was one in which you must choose to love every day.***THE REMAINDER OF THIS  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, SO DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING!***When they return from the outside, they're just accepted. It's okay. Peace, love, and happiness, and Marcus slinks quietly away to find absolute power somewhere else. Really? Some things just get glossed over, and I wanted to see and feel and live the reactions. Maybe my heart for this story died with Tris. Maybe I should reread it. But knowing the end, I can't. From a plot and storyline perspective, if I was just reading a synopsis, I like the story and felt it a believable outcome.One of the better parts for me is the off the cuff change of plans that Four employs at the end. He finally trusts himself. He finally grows into a person who can find the end without means that are destructive. And, just as he grows, he loses the one person he loves the most. As he gains the love of his mother, he loses Tris. Evelyn's ominous foreshadowing (you will never be in the new world with my son) comes to bear. I understand the author's point, but the fact that this story ends without a chance at happiness for some of my favorite characters knocks it right off of my re-read list. Kind of like Game of Thrones. As long as I don't open book 5, Arya lives. So I will never read it (until George RR Martin assures me she lives, which he won't!). While I thought the plot was well conceived and a fitting end, it is heart wrenching that Tris never gets to see the peace she enables. But that's life. Stark realism. But, in life, there are many ways to be happy and find happiness and I (as many readers) would've rather seen David die than Tris. In the end, a simple bullet kills her. Maybe in a world so dedicated to peace there wouldn't be a place for Tris. But, in the end, I feel like Four.

Divergent and Insurgent were both five star reads and I eagerly jumped into Allegiant upon their completion. Allegiant takes a different style and faces different challenges but kept with the same captivating style that keeps you racing for more. All in all, however, this novel is rated as FOUR STAR read.Again, Allegiant picks up right where the last book, Insurgent, left off. Tris is outside of the city heading to a destination unknown. They eventually meet up with the bureau of genetics and that is where things start to heat up. Instantly there is conflict and you find yourself not only in Tris' mind but also Tobias'. At first I was weary of this back and forth perspective because the authors style of writing is the same for both minds and it was occasionally confusing as to who I was reading from. However, by the end of the novel it becomes quite obvious why this method of writing suited the author. I won't tell you why, you'll have to read it yourself and find out ;)There are a few new villains now that Janine has been defeated. Conflict rises in the city and outside as well. Tris is left with monstrous decisions and Tobias tries his hardest as well to keep up and find his own ways of supporting their efforts. I found that within this novel there was too much conflict between Tris and Tobias, my two newest favourite characters within the novel. I found myself frusturated that they just couldn't smile and make up quicker than they do.I won't spoil anything within this novel but I will say that it is an emotional roller coaster as the author has no issues introducing new characters throughout the series only to have them die off eventually. You come to love some of the lost characters and mourn for them through your tears (or at least I did ;)So my two obvious favourite characters are Tris and Tobias, the stories main characters. But other than that, I found that I related a lot to Cara.It's strange to see people you don't know well in the morning, with sleepy eyes and pillow creases in their cheeks; to know that Christina is cheerful in the morning, and Peter wakes up with his hair perfectly flat, but Cara communicates only through a series of grunts, inching her way, limb by limb, toward coffee.The main reason this novel lost a star is due to the fact that: (1) The back and forth between Tris' perspective and Tobias' was hard to follow at times because the writing style never differed, and (2) I didn't like the ending all that much. I could come up with a few different endings that would have satisfied me more. That being said, all in all, it was still an amazing read. Slower than the first two books, but just as interesting.My FactionAt the end of this book was a faction quiz. So like every other Divergent fan out there I took that quiz.

I'm a 33 year-old woman and I'm so glad my kids were in bed and my husband was not home when I read the end.  I cried so much I'm almost ashamed of it. But, I think there is something to be said about an author who can create such a story and such characters that the reader becomes that emotionally affected. I've read plenty of books, and I've never been so heart-wrenched by a story before, yet so satisfied with the outcome.I think it was beautiful and - sad as it was - the perfect way to end the story. Many of the other positive reviews are right - I don't particularly want unhappy endings, but mushy perfect \"happy\" stories make me want to vomit. It's not always meaningful.But, really, it DID have a happy ending. Tris sacrificed herself so that the man and the friends she loved don't have to live in a world where they are seen as damaged. No one else could have given that kind of gift. Plus, she didn't do it just to die for her friends - she honestly thought she could survive, and I think that makes a big difference. There are so many other good things to say about this trilogy - hints that these characters believe in God, suicide isn't a solution out of a tricky situation (which is my biggest complaint about another popular trilogy), and all of the characters come full circle in so many ways.I don't understand why so many are complaining about the writing style or it being boring. It's the same as the other books. This one may have had a little less action, but the characters were in a new situation and had to take time to adjust and figure out what was going on. Makes perfect sense. And, I don't understand why everyone is also being critical of Evelyn's choice. Yeah, it might have been her life's work, but it cost her child. Have you never suddenly realized something you were working on wasn't worth it anymore? She was tired, she was beginning to doubt.

Soon, Tris, Four and some others choose to leave Chicago and pursue the meaning of the Edith Prior video.  Most of the remaining story takes place inside a special facility a short drive from Chicago, where we find out what the story is about Chicago and the factions, as well as what it really means to be divergent.  Three-quarters of the way into this story, I was very disappointed.  It felt like the author was just going through the motions, and frankly, the story was boring and dull--lots of talking and philosophical introspection, but not much plot movement.  The last quarter of the book salvaged things for me and raised the story from one star to 3.5.  No, like a thousand others, I didn't like the ending, and I didn't think the ending was necessitated in any way by the story arc.  It seemed almost as if the author realized the story about to crash and burn, so she tossed in this ending to slap us in the face.  HOWEVER, the ending was well done and beautifully written, and it was quite evocative.  I thought the writing went from passable and average to excellent and gripping.  BUT, I'm only at 3.5 stars because the ending doesn't really fit the overall trilogy IMO.  So, for those that want a 'they all lived happily ever after' ending, don't read this book.  Stop with Insurgent and think up your own ending.  For those of you, who--like Tris--aren't afraid to jump off the roof into the net below, you should read it and experience the pain.

Allegiant definitely had a different feel to it than the other two books, most of Allegiant took place outside the city.

It is a young adult (YA), dystopian society book set in Chicago at some point in the near future.  Overall, I thought this was a disappointing conclusion to the series for a variety of reasons including the narration, the change in the two main characters, the overabundance of romance scenes, the premise behind the central conflict, and the ending.  Below is a spoiler-free recap of these things.The narration switches between Tris and Tobias (Four) constantly throughout the book was confusing and unexpected since the reader understand things from Tris&#8217; point of view.  There is a name heading at the beginning of each chapter to tell you whose point of you view you are following; however, I found myself having to stop to recall whose point of view I was reading since they were both first-person, and to be honest sounded a lot a like.While the narration switches were annoying, the actual characters of Tris and Tobias seemed to be a lot weaker than in the previous books.  I don&#8217;t know if that was the author&#8217;s choice to show a weaker version of the two, but it seemed to be a bit of a letdown that they were not the same strong, action-oriented characters as before.  You cannot even factor in the passage of time since this book takes place immediately after the previous one &#8211; there is no time for sudden growth and change in the characters.I know this book is in the YA category, but I also wonder if it was trying to be a romance as well.  It seemed like there was a much stronger focus on Tris and Tobias relationship, and it was more detailed than the previous books where the author used it to transition between scenes.  In &#8220;Allegiant&#8221; it seemed to be a central element, and it still seemed a bit dysfunctional at times as the two work out their issues.One of my biggest complaints is with the central conflict.  For two books, we&#8217;ve read about the secret information inside Chicago &#8211; information so important that that it would lead to killing.  A faction war is brewing and at the end of book two we finally have some more of the truth revealed.  Book three continues with that revelation, but it takes a backseat to a new conflict in the final book that didn&#8217;t seem very well thought out and somewhat weak overall.My other big complaint with this book is the ending.  Since this is a spoiler-free review, I won&#8217;t provide details about what happens, but I will touch on the illogical motivations and result.  Perhaps I&#8217;m thinking too much like Spock or Sheldon Cooper, but it seems like the actions the characters take should include some logic and alternatives especially if those actions are dangerous.  With &#8220;Allegiant&#8221;, it was more like &#8220;This is what we have to do and there is no other alternative.&#8221;  It seemed like the ending was more about shock value and discussion than it was about bringing the story to a satisfying conclusion.", "reviewerName": "Kyle L.

I thought it all flowed and made sense.The reason for my 3 star review is the writing. As a 46 year old, I really don't expect stellar writing from YA literature, but this just didn't seem to be as well written as the first two.I also could not stand the chapters going back and forth between Tris and Tobius. I can't remember if the first two books were like this, but I don't remember it having bothered me if it was. The storyline went in a way that it could not have just been from Tris' point of view, but I would have rather had it written in the third person.To conclude, I am very surprised at the extreme 1 star reviews.

I'm not saying that was intended, obviously I can only speculate what was in the authors mind. Regardless, that is the way it \"felt\" to this reader.Not only that, it felt so pointless... there wasn't anything revolutionary or thought-provoking that gave comfort and purpose to the pain you felt reading the end. One of my favorite movies is \"Pay It Forward\" which ends in the death of the main character, and a child at that. It even ends just when everything seems to be looking up for the little guy. It ripped my heart out, but it replaced that pain with hope, understanding, and \"awe\" at seeing just exactly how far-reaching the actions of that character were. Just writing about it now gives me chills.Allegiant was nothing at all like that. I don't feel like it would have taken much to show the effect and impact the sacrifice here had on the world, not just one character. I suppose I'm just as disappointed for all the possibilities and promise it had, but didn't take advantage of. I may have missed the author's point, but the author's point is lost without more definition for those who don't have those characters inside their head/heart and need a little more detail to \"get them there.\"Now, those going to the extreme of being just downright hateful are going way overboard for a book.  Death threats - take a deep breath and get a grip!  I'm also not going to be overly hasty and say I'll NEVER read one of her books again - never say never.

Anytime I try to formulate a sentence I just have one thing I want to say&#8230; and I can&#8217;t.I started the Divergent series straight off the heels of The Hunger Games trilogy. Prior to reading that, I had only read a handful of YA so I was desperate to find something that made me feel like The Hunger Games did. Luckily, it took me no time as my local bookstore had Divergent labeled as &#8220;If you liked The Hunger Games try this&#8230;&#8221;. I dove into Divergent and fell completely in love with it. I had no idea it was the first book in a trilogy when I picked it up, but lucky for me I had waited so long to fall in love with YA that Insurgent was just days away from release. I had no idea that this trilogy would do things to my heart the way it did. I have loved AND hated the same character from one book to another, I have cried and I have screamed and it&#8217;s so entirely weird to me that this is how It ends. It&#8217;s done&#8230; and I don&#8217;t know how to sum into words the catastrophic event that my heart just happened to go through in the prior hours.I am going to keep this spoiler free as possible, for Allegiant. Divergent and Insurgent spoilers will be inevitable so if you haven&#8217;t read those two yet, I suggest stopping now. I have linked to Goodreads at the end, so list a few additional thoughts in a spoiler tag.Tris, quite possibly, might be one of the strangest written characters for me. I loved her in Divergent, just adored her. I thought she was strong, but emotional, kind but tough&#8230; and I just really liked and appreciated her for her qualities. I practically detested her in Insurgent. I hated her whinyness, and her inability to think about anyone but herself and probably the biggest reason was for the way she constantly hurt Four. Well, I loved her all over again in Allegiant. She was almost entirely back to the Tris I fell in love with in Divergent and I have to thank Veronica Roth for giving me back the heroine that originally made me love this series. Surprisingly, Four who I have consistently loved from book to book was the character that I wasn&#8217;t to scream at. He seemed so irrational in Allegiant at times and it more than frustrated me. He did come to be the Four I loved again, but&#8230; I didn&#8217;t much enjoy that I spent a large part of the book being angry with him. Christina, will always be a favorite of mine and I have liked her consistently throughout the series. Uriah and Zeke were two of my favorites from the beginning of the series, and they might be two of the characters I am saddest to leave. I loved their personalities and how they played an equally important part to both Tris and Four.For the first 25% of Allegiant I thought it was very good, fast paced and it held my attention. Then the next 55% of the book was so slow-paced that I honestly expected I would have to put it down for good&#8230; well, I reached a certain point at the end where my entire stomach region may have, in fact, been lodged into my throat so for that, Veronica Roth, kudos to you because only excellent writing can do that to a person.I LOVED the dual point of view. The fact that we could view this story from both Tris & Tobias&#8217;s eyes was fantastic. I think it wouldn&#8217;t have had as big of an impact on me if it wasn&#8217;t for that. I especially loved Tobias&#8217;s voice. It especially becomes import with the dual point of view towards the end of story and I think Roth made an excellent choice by writing like this.One of my biggest disappointments of Allegiant was the predictibility. I had somewhat of an idea or expectation where the story was going to go after Insurgent. I really loved the ending of the second book, but I had this idea in my mind what was going to happen and I wasn&#8217;t entirely wrong. I also wanted MORE. I felt starved of an amazing story when I finished and that is probably my biggest problem with the ending. I mean, Roth took this book where I&#8217;m sure no one thought it would go, I sure as hell didn&#8217;t at least and I HATED THAT. I think she achieved a shock value and surprise that we may not see again for a very long time but I hated the way she did it. The actual event that takes place is not even the part that bothers me &#8230; it&#8217;s the way it was done. I don&#8217;t think it did the characters, or the series the justice it deserves.I enjoyed the epilogue however, and that did actually cast Allegiant in a better light for me but I&#8217;m sad to say that I was expecting a bit more from the ending of one of my favorite series and I didn&#8217;t get it.My review is impossible to sum up my feelings, I also don&#8217;t think that you should hold my review in much regard when it comes to Allegiant.

Veronica Roth suddenly goes into two character points of view, which is fine with me, because I actually enjoy seeing the different perspectives. However, it felt like Tobias and Tris were the same exact person. Tobias seemed completely different from the other books, and she wrote Tobias and Tris the exact same way, which is not only confusing, but very disappointing. Also, the other thing I didn't like about this book is that the plot gets very confusing. I think the author took way to huge of a step when she started getting into the genetics. This is what mainly lost my interest, because I didn't understand it completely and it just got dull.

Instead of limiting itself to Tris&#8217; perspective, the novel alternates between her and Tobias/Four. Many find this confusing because their narrative voices are very similar. I didn&#8217;t have trouble or think too much of it but then, I had just finished a different YA novel with a similar narrative technique that was executed in a poorer manner (the review of which, I will post next week).

It was very limited to the US. And the information we were given just wasn't enough. I almost feel like this series could have had more than three books.3.) The characters I knew and loved were different. Tobias made decisions, not good ones, and that's fine. He doesn't need to be perfect, but the decisions still didn't seem like him. They didn't seem like things that would compel him. Tris seemed cold to me, too controlling. Just like in Insurgent, except perhaps not as suicidal. Evelyn, Marcus, Peter, and Caleb also weren't the same or realistic.4.) Finally the ending. I don't know if Ms. Roth became cocky and decided to kill Tris because she was trying to be literary and not just write for the fans. I don't understand if she was trying to prove Tris' selflessness...anyway I hated it. Tobias was left with pretty much no one. It didn't bring the series any closure at all.

So once I had ALLEGIANT in my hands, I was ready to see what author Veronica Roth had in store for her final book in the Divergent trilogy.This book is classified as a dystopian. It's a strict world that's built on secrets. There will, of course, be discord and chaos. This is also a war story--people are going to get hurt; other people will lose their lives. So if a reader approaches this type of story and expects sunshine and flowers, the story is already an injustice.Everyone has a right to their opinion, and you can get angry, and you can rage over the things that happen in this book; I've gotten angry over many books.

I admit, I was unprepared for the ending.

The writing has always been an iffy point, but it was always engaging. I had such a hard time getting into the book. I've never been a fan of dual points of view and it doesn't help that Tris and Four sound the same. Also, for being narrated by two people, the views were so limited. It took forever to learn anything new. And their romance feels so forced.

And what I've decided is this: I am OK with the ending - it's not my favorite, but it does feel true to the individual characters and the overall storyline and theme of the trilogy. While I appreciate when a series leaves me with emotional satisfaction, this isn't the purpose of all books, and an author owes us nothing. Roth did what she felt she needed to do  - this is her work - and I respect that. It's thought-provoking, and that's powerful in its own right.But I still can't rate Allegiant 5 stars, because the larger problem for me with the book are the holes in the 'big reveal' we get. Divergent and Insurgent created an intriguing world for us, with the faction structure creating a fascinating lens through which to comment on our own contemporary society - this is how the best dystopian fiction functions. The problem with Allegiant is that the 'big reveal' - the story behind how this world was originally created - just has too many holes and leaves too many loose ends. How is this genetic agency able to run so independently? Where is the rest of the government and everyone else? How is it that no one has escaped from these experiments, or has always been caught? How do they have cameras all over the experiment, capturing every moment, and no one in the experiment ever becomes aware of this? Then there is the matter of the memory-wipe and death serums, and that there is one per faction - the serums are just way too convenient and feel contrived.Combine that with Tris's and Four's love affair getting a bit annoying at times, and Allegiant just wasn't as satisfying as the first two books.

{"reviewTime": "10 25, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "This review and more can be found on my blog, The Library Canary: [...]I&#8217;ve been waiting for this book for so long. We&#8217;ve all been waiting for this book for so long. When it arrived at my house on Tuesday, I practically ran to the door and ripped the box out of the delivery guy&#8217;s hands. I danced around my living room with it like an idiot. Then I started reading. And I realized that we got to read from Four&#8217;s perspective! I don&#8217;t know how I didn&#8217;t know this, but I didn&#8217;t. I was pumped. I love multiple POVs and I&#8217;ve wanted to get inside Four&#8217;s head for a while. (I haven&#8217;t read any of the novellas yet.)Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the shifting POVs. Four&#8217;s voice wasn&#8217;t very distinct. I found myself forgetting that I was reading from his perspective. Then, when he would say something like &#8220;Tris said&#8221;, it would jar me. His voice and Tris&#8217;s just sounded so similar. They are such different people that it shouldn&#8217;t have been like this. I understand why Veronica Roth chose to write from both perspectives. It was necessary to the story, but it could have been done a lot better. In addition, I kind of felt like Four turned into a wimp in this book. And maybe it&#8217;s because we were in his head, but I just always saw him as this super strong character and in this book I saw an insecure child. He lost some of his swoon-factor for me.I have been dying to know what&#8217;s outside the city for a year now. Then I found out and it was like a slowly deflating balloon. So disappointing. I thought it was kind of lame. Not exciting at all. Just more typical dystopian novel stuff. This book was a lot slower paced than the first two. At times I felt like the plot was dragging. I think if what had been outside the city was&#8230;.cooler?&#8230;.the plot would have moved a lot faster. But it didn&#8217;t. And I was sad.Tris and Four still hadn&#8217;t worked their crap out in this book. I wanted them to be together, truly be together for the majority of this book. And they weren&#8217;t. They were still constantly bickering and arguing. I miss their relationship from Divergent. That being said, the times that they were together in this book were magical and had me crying and squealing.&#8220;I fell in love with him. But I don&#8217;t just stay with him by default as if there&#8217;s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.&#8221; &#8211;TrisI love Tris so much. She's so smart and so brave and she's come so far throughout this trilogy. She's one of the most kick-ass characters I've ever read about. Every book she has learned something new and this one is no exception. I just wish that Four would listen to her!!!Four on the other hand, seemed to go backwards in this book. He didn't seem like he learned anything and he almost seemed to get careless. I felt like he didn't develop at all in this book. Maybe he just didn&#8217;t develop the way I wanted him to. I don&#8217;t even know. I&#8217;m so confused over my feelings for this book. I was really happy that Four got some closure with his parents though. His relationships with both his mom and his dad were really complicated and he was able to deal with them in this book.If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, prepare yourselves. Not everybody makes it out. Veronica Roth was not afraid to kill her characters. And I approved. Sad as it was (I cried so many tears), I admire the fact that she took the risk. This is a dystopian society. The city of Chicago is extremely unsettled. War is brewing between faction supporters and the factionless. Death is part of war and Roth doesn&#8217;t let us forget.I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to rate this book since I started writing this review. I just don&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t hate it. Everybody is in an uproar over the ending. The ending shocked me. I never saw it coming, but I understood it. And I felt like, had I opened my eyes throughout the whole series, I would have seen it coming. So I really didn&#8217;t hate the book. But I didn&#8217;t really enjoy it either. At least not like I enjoyed the first two books. So how do I rate this?Veronica Roth did tie everything up nicely. I didn&#8217;t have any unanswered questions. She closed it up enough that we knew where all the characters were, but also left the world open enough that we&#8217;re not sure exactly what was going to happen in the future. It was the perfect combination.&#8220;Sometimes it [bravery] is nothing more than gritting your teeth through the pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life.&#8221; &#8211;FourThe writing was beautiful. I will give Veronica Roth that. There are so many sticky notes in my copy. It&#8217;s crazy how many lines I marked. There were lots of feels in this book about many different things. I pretty much cried the whole time reading. My heart is broken. My soul is broken. I feel empty. But, I think I&#8217;m going to give it a solid 3 stars. Obviously you should read this book. Especially if you&#8217;ve already read Divergent and Insurgent. Even if you haven&#8217;t, you should read this series. It&#8217;s a great series with lots of lessons learned and some awesome kick-ass characters. I guess I just expected more out of this conclusion and I didn&#8217;t get it.

{"reviewTime": "10 22, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Allegiant is a very powerful book. It pushes limits, breaks hearts and always, always makes you think. It is much more complex than most young adult novels in its challenges of what is logical versus what is right. The characters are infinitely human, neither heroes nor villains, at least not fully.Tobias reveals vulnerabilities I never would have guessed he had, and yet, they were completely believable and right for his personality and past. I loved that half of the novel was told from his point of view; the darkness and desperation he fights against were so intense it hurt my heart.Tris' side is less complicated and she doesn't change as much as Four, but her coming to terms with her family, living and dead, strengthened her character in subtle but significant ways. She gains a deeper understanding of things, which in turn gives the reader a deeper understanding of the characters and their motivations.While I loved so many things in this book, the writing didn't really pop as much as the previous novels, at least not for me and not in the beginning. At first it felt like a lot of exposition as a hundred new things had to be explained all at once. This might have been necessary, but it was also kind of awkward. Towards the middle it gained more intensity and the pace picked up, and by the end I was on the edge of my seat. Crying.The end was perfect. Heroic and sad and beautiful and unexpected and so very, very brave. Not just on the characters' parts, but on the author's as well.

They war on the five-star and one-star extremes. I don't provide star ratings because I dislike slating books together in a category when they are so completely different and how I felt about them was so completely different.In this case, I will make an exception and clarify that this was a 5-star book. I'll explain it the best I can without spoilers.For those who have already finished Allegiant and still have questions, Veronica Roth wrote this COMPLETELY SPOILERY End of Allegiant Explanation on her blog here: [...]Ok, let's get started. Some series enders feel like a rush-to-finish story where all of the loose ends are haphazardly tied together for a \"ta-da\" moment at the end. Allegiant is not like that at all.While there are certainly a ton of story lines and relationships that need resolving in this final book, Roth takes her time getting there, weaving and threading the future with the past. Tris, Tobias and their friends risk it all to see what the truth is beyond the fence and what it means for the factions and their lives.And that's something Roth does extraordinarily well - explain the toughest parts of life. Love, loss, heartbreak, joy and faith.Like this: \"I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him be default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses. me.\"Allegiant is simply filled with sparkling revelations like that one that make you want to weep with the truth of it.This novel stayed true to the previous books. Some feel like the end doesn't make fit in with the story as a whole, but I couldn't disagree more.Tris and Tobias develop even more in Allegiant and make decisions that fit in with their growth and maturity. In this book, the story became more than just factions and romance and frienships. It was about society and devastation and rebuilding.I loved that Allegiant had a more serious tone and stayed true to its core message: people are more than the sum total of their parts.This was an incredible series and more than getting a cookie-cutter, predictable ending, I got ideas. Ideas about how we live and think and about how people in the world of Divergent coped and loved and progressed. And that to me was more powerful and memorable than everything happening \"the way it should.\"OVERALL:This book will make many of you sad and angry.

{"reviewTime": "10 30, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "2.5 stars rounded up.Be Aware: Whilst I do not exactly give away the ending this review could be said to contain minor spoilers. And possibly major ones if you read between the lines.Blurb : Told from a riveting dual perspective, Allegiant, by #1 New York Times best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the Divergent series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in Divergent and Insurgent.Yeah. But no. Sigh. Pfft. Oh where to start. Darn it, I try and build up a reputation for being able to find the positive in everything and here I am actually struggling. So again I say Pfft.Ok, having given myself a few minutes there are positives. I won't have to read it again. Oops thats rather an ironic positive. Lets go for a more positive positive. The quality of the writing has not diminished. Ms Roth can still put words together into sentences and make them jump off the page. Great. Thats one of the things that made Divergent and Insurgent so compelling. She's a damn good writer. Characterisation is (was?) top notch and the world is (was?) well imagined...thats why many readers have been holding their breath for the promised \"stunning\" conclusion of the series. Well job done. It WAS stunning. Although perhaps not in the way one might have hoped...For the early part I kind of enjoyed it...I disliked the dual points of view especially because I worked out fairly quickly why we were going to need such a thing, and despite my hanging on in there in the hope that I was wrong - I was not. Which in and of itself left me uninspired - a writer of the calibre of Ms Roth really should be able to surprise me. After all she has done it once or twice over the course of the first two novels.  Then shortly after Tris and Co hit the \"outside\" world it started to annoy me..then I started to swear at it.The whole \"genetics\" thing seemed illogical given what had gone before. It was also a terribly dull explanation considering the lead in and the inspired writing that gave us Dauntless, Erudite et al and how the ending of \"Insurgent\" hinted at the possibility of something unique and wonderful to come. The new characters were a bit wooden - possibly because, this being the last novel, there was nowhere really for them to go - so yes. Uninspired. Thats me.Now I'm back to this. Sigh. Pfft. Disappointed.Final thoughts.  Some people have called Ms Roth brave for the ending she gave us, others have called her cliched, others still have said she has betrayed her loyal following. Me I sit here. This is her story, her vision, her ending. So in that sense it is what it should be. For me though it felt wrong. I disliked it intensely and I'm not afraid to say so. Ms Roth has not betrayed me, she wrote her ending and its my choice to not like it.  I would agree there is some cliche, and I would also agree it was kind of brave....I also wonder if the movie trilogy (assuming they all get made) will have a different ending. I imagine it will...Happy Reading Folks!**Hardback purchased via Amazon UK **", "reviewerName": "Liz Wilkins \"Lizzy11268\"", "summary": "Hmm.", "helpful": [3, 3], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383091200, "reviewerID": "A34NG31NRN7WJL"}
{"reviewTime": "01 9, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I was not a fan of this series.  Teen dystopia is over done and gimmicky.  Throughout this series, I excused this fact because the main relationship between Tris and Tobias had some potential.  Mind you, I was never fully convinced of their ages, but given the &#34;world &#34; created for them I excused this as well...(Tobias would be preternatural in his fully ripened manhood if he were even 23-24 let alone 18...but hey I let it slide.)The world created in this series was utterly silly artifice.  Any intelligent teenager would find it  an over-simplified attempt at allegory of teen society.  But hey....everyone needs something to read....I get it.  Also, secondary characters were meaningless, utterly expendable in their lack of vitality or development...ok whatever.However, what was refreshing was the relationship between Tobias and Tris, and particularly the character of Tobias.  In the first two books, Roth had  written a lovely man with Tobias.  Sure he is  rippled with bo-hunky muscles and tats....but he was more than that....he was a fully ripened man.  He was confident and calm without being patronizing.  He was tough and accepting and perceptive.  He respected other people and mostly he respected Tris.  He understood that she needed whatever she needed and did not judge her for this, and (most importantly to parents of teenagers here) he was fine with her needing to lead and be strong in her own way, not because he &#34;let&#34; her, but because he loved her.  He was a true man...as I said before this is way unbelievable for an 18 year old even in a dystopian future....but hey like in Ender's Game, I aged him by 6 years or so in my mind.Then, as if she didn't understand what she had written in the previous two books, Roth decides to emasculate her character in the third book.  It doesnt help that she took the &#34;cowards&#34; way out and created the device of a dual narrative (horribly executed) in order to write this third in the series.  It was a glib disservice to his character to not at least have made the effort to develop his narrative properly.But what really emasculated him was taking away the true manhood of his character.  Why would a fully confident whole adult male suddenly need to &#34;grow up&#34; and mature more?  Sure, given his circumstances, he would be unsure, bewildered and not himself in this chapter of the story.  Sure, given that he was a human being he would still have some fears (four to be exact), but it seems that Roth confuses these things with maturity or lack thereof.A mature man can be hero and a resolved, complete, compassionate and smart one at that, AND he can still be worried, irresolute and make mistakes.  This does not mean he is child, it means he is human.  But Roth seems bent on using these reactions in her character of Tobias,  to make further assumptions that he is just a &#34;teenaged boy after all&#34;.  Then she throws the &#34;baby out with the bathwater&#34; and has him become a sulking, unhappy insecure jerk which of course kills the romance completely....(and this was a romance after all right????)Probably if you got down to the meat of it, you would find that this confusion arrises from an author who does not really know men, or has not yet had a mature relationship with one and most likely let one preternaturally hottie in her life walk away.", "reviewerName": "Lizzie girl", "summary": "Why emasculate ?", "helpful": [13, 13], "overall": 1.0, "unixReviewTime": 1389225600, "reviewerID": "A1HW3PIO3VCUQ4"}

Once the main characters walk outside the city, the author runs out of story.  It's really unfortunate that she kept writing anyway, because &#34;Allegiant&#34; spoils what started out as an interesting, reasonably plotted story.***SPOILERS***It is spoiled, not because the main character dies, but because the author dumps a lot of implausible hoopla in our laps that adds nothing to the series, and creates problems that were not an issue in the previous books.  In fact, Tris dying is the only thing in the book that makes sense.For example, we discover that all you need to do to leave Chicago is get on a train, ride to the border, then take a truck the last few yards past the fence. Which makes you wonder why the factionless have been content to hang about Chicago, cleaning toilets and starving, generation after generation, when all they needed to do was leave.We also discover that the people inside the city have altered, defective genes.  The &#34;divergents&#34; are the only normal people, with normal, unmodified genes. Which leaves the reader wondering, why exactly are normal humans resistant to mind altering drugs?We discover there are lots of normal people outside Chicago who have normal, unmodified genes. These genetically &#34;pure&#34; individuals are capable of producing children.  Yet, they've decided to shove a bunch of people with altered genes into a city for a few generations on the off chance that some of them might produce normal children. In other words, the existence of the city makes no sense at all.When the book was about the misunderstandings that arise between people with different temperaments (a very real, and often relationship destroying problem), the author was doing pretty well. It was good that she pointed out that there are physical and genetic differences between people to explain many personality differences, I think people need to be aware of that fact, it helps encourage tolerance.  I can even see some merit in imagining a group of scientists making a misguided attempt to breed a generation of people with more flexible, multi-temperament minds, then losing control of the experiment. An experiment run amok is good, solid, and traditional sci-fi plotting and it could have been used to bring out many of the themes the author apparently wishes to address in her books.But the author starts floundering when she attempts to convince us that our perceptions of the situation in the first two books were all wrong. Tris is normal, and by golly, so is everyone else. So let's shed a tear for the fallen, set aside our fears, remember that God forgives all, and so should we.  I see where she was trying to go with it all, I even applaud her direction, but she created plot holes all along the path and then filled them full of trash.

{"reviewTime": "02 14, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Veronica Roth left us with an epic revelation and cliffhanger in INSURGENT, and we can now see the Divergent journey through to completion with ALLEGIANT. If you've not read the first two installments in this worldwide best-selling YA dystopian trilogy, be warned that the following review will glance by plot points better discovered on your own in those two novels. However, I will not throw in spoilers from ALLEGIANT. And, unlike most of my reviews, this one will primarily concentrate on Roth's writing style, because I can't add to this book's blurb without ruining the surprises you've got coming!Catch up with me by reading...Divergent...and...Insurgent (Divergent, Book 2) (Divergent Series)...if you haven't, and come back!Picking up with Tris awaiting trial in lock-up and Four roaming the halls of Erudite/Factionless headquarters, Roth has made changes to or exaggerated parts of her prose which may or may not fit your taste. The most obvious is the switch to two narrators. Delirium, Matched, Partials, Legend, and Letters to Nowhere are YA series with at least one book with a single and one book with multiple narrators. Some series' volumes received more acclaim with reviewers with one narrator; some with duel narration; others saw no measureable difference. The common factors in the rating upswings appear to be easily-distinguished personalities of the protagonists and little variation in what readers expect from their favorite characters.* Did VR employ differing writing styles to separate T's and F's narrations? No.* If there weren't names heading each chapter, could I tell who was speaking? Rarely.Did VR include context clues to keep the narrator's identity in the forefront of my mind at all times? Rarely.Beyond the voice of the narrator, the pacing of the book should feel natural. The timing of each narrators' experiences should be clearly indicated to allow the reader to build a mental timeline. As these experiences occur, short and long sentences should be varied, to keep from bogging the reader down in a rhythm. Conversations which take a stated number of minutes should last longer than a few lines of dialog and be balanced by other characters progressing in whatever their projects were at the time. The last book in a series is often not the correct place for \"all\" fine details on dystopian technology, history, and genes; authors should present enough answers prior to the omniscient book - at least to satisfy an inquisitive teen growing up in the environment and who'll be asking, \"Why?\" (And don't tell me that you can modify that out of them).* Did VR have clear timeline delineation? No.* Characterize VR's sentences? Always short/choppy* VR's individual scene structure...? Often feels rushed* Did VR clear up lingering Qs about tech, history, and genes? Yes (in the 3rd book)After each few chapters, I would check to see how much of ALLEGIANT was left. Closer and closer to the end, and I still had no idea how Roth would wrap up the story before I was out of pages. Then, the biggest, most impossible scene in YA history! Roth took a risk, and many readers aren't happy. Then, a double-digit number of additional chapters. I won't tell you the shocker (That is the point of the book?), but I also don't want you going in wholly unprepared. Grab the box of tissues and whatever is your comfort food. If you set the novel on fire afterword's, I won't blame you (Sadly, I have an e-reader.). But Roth's chances paid off in at least one way. We'll all remember Roth, Divergent, and \"the\" bravery that was truly dauntless.* Did the trilogy end suddenly? Yes and no* About that ending? Tear-jerker alert!* Sexual content? Kissing/touchingNow, readers will be debating which character embodied which faction virtue- Candor the Honest, Amity the Peaceful, Erudite the Intelligent, Abnegation the Selfless, and Dauntless the Brave. Some may argue that these no longer matter, but I believe otherwise. Veronica Roth did her best to teach us to overcome our own human nature. Even the best of us cling most often to one avenue for personal character improvement. No one says, \"I should be better at...\" and lists a number of self-reflective choices, which will likely benefit the community, just as much as herself. Though the trilogy is complete, let us all continue to strive to be divergent in our behavior, whether or not we liked the trilogy's ending.Perhaps, dear readers, the unpalatable ending is the greatest gift of all. We learn afresh the Divergent values bone-deep at the end and receive a conclusion no other best-selling YA author of my acquaintance dared to offer up until ALLEGIANT. Roth was a first-time author; she was still learning. And yet, she will follow me long after I forget many of the must-haves on my TBR.Have you read...Julie Cross'sLetters to Nowhere (Letters to Nowhere Part 1)Lauren Oliver'sDeliriumMarie Lu'sLegendDan Well'sPartials (The Partials Sequence)Ally Condie'sMatched", "reviewerName": "Lori Parker", "summary": "Veronica Roth completes the trilogy with dauntless writing experiments, but not all are right for ALLEGIANT (Divergent #3)", "helpful": [1, 1], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1392336000, "reviewerID": "A351A2418T54US"}

I was so excited to read the finale of this trilogy.  It ended up taking me several days to read because I was just BORED.  I found myself putting it down and finding other things to do when I would have had time to read.*Spoilers*1.  I did not like the POV switching.  After writing the first two books in the same format, it just didn't flow right to change things up.  I understood why VR did it that way, but it just didn't work.2.  While we all hope for a happy ending, we all knew that was probably not going to happen with the way Tris lived her life.  I don't take issue with the fact that it ended the way it did, just HOW it ended.  There were so many alternatives to the ending that VR could have chosen though.  It seemed so abrupt, weak, and disappointing.3.  Character building just wasn't there.  Tobias did develop closer to the end of this novel, but most of the book, he was just so monotonous.  Tris ended the book pretty much the way she started.  There was no build in her, it's like VR had already brought her to the peak in the previous two books and didn't know what to do with her in this one.  Both Tobias and Tris got so blah though, that when the POV's changed, sometimes it took me several paragraphs to realize it changed.  Yes, I know it says it right at the beginning of the chapter, but I'm usually eager to get to the text so I skip over chapter titles.4.  How did Caleb never offer a reason for allowing Tris to die other than Jeanine was persuasive?  Yet Tris forgave him like that?  Caleb shouldn't have even been in the book the way she used him, he was just a completely pointless character.

In fact, it might be one of the worst books I have ever read. Never mind the pointless ending, but the writing itself was atrocious. We started the series in the mind of Tris, and her character was pretty obvious. There was a VERY distinct tone of the first two books in this series, and I think that's what made me fall in love with the books. Roth had a unique and addictive writing style that is completely absent in this novel!!!! It's GONE. Tris and Four behaved in ways they NEVER should have, going along with things they would have never considered in the first two books. I'm all for character development, but not a complete re-write of the characters we fell in love with. Not only did Tris turn into a spineless, whiny little brat, but Four lost so much of his mysterious-bad-boy demeanor that he didn't even seem like the same character.Allegiant read like Roth was bored; like she HAD to finish the series but didn't quite feel like putting all her effort into it.... which is odd because the book IS lengthy, but the quality is AWFUL. I can't begin to tell you how angry and upset I was all day after staying up ALL NIGHT on its release day, but as soon as I started Allegiant I knew I was in for disappointment. I feel betrayed as a fan and not only did I return the book, but I will never, EVER buy another novel by Veronica Roth again.

My review is simply to express my displeasure with the message Roth sent to young adults in the final book (and through her blog).Throughout the series, Tris was constantly flirting with death in the name of sacrifice and ultimately dies in the same vein, once she apparently fully understands the meaning of sacrifice.  Why not have Tris be a strong heroine who saves the day by finding an alternative? Instead, the author is telling young adults that as long as you love someone, you're strong enough, and it's (arguably) necessary (the three criteria she lays out in her blog), go ahead and die. Forget trying to find another way to solve your problems. I hate to think how young adults might translate this message into their own lives and their own problems.  I don't think self-imposed death (even in the name of sacrifice) should be revered in young adult literature.

It was impossible to tell the difference between when Tris was narrating and when Tobias was. Half the time I would be halfway through the chapter and completely forget who was speaking. If you are going to write in two different voices, make sure the reader can tell them apart.Second, the entire idea of GPs. I'm sorry but I just didn't buy it. It seemed such a boring way to explain the factions. If you are going to have this become about genetics it needs to be more in depth. I felt cheated with the whole genetically pure versus defected. It made the entire first two books seem useless and unimportant.Third, Tris' death. I am completely fine with an author having creative freedom and I am cool with a story not having a happy ending BUT and this is a big but if you are going to kill off the main character it has to matter. Tris' death was pointless, she survived the death serum only to be shot is just pointless. There was no need to do this other than to show the reader what they already know, we live in a sad and unfair world. The reader doesn't need to be reaffirmed of what they already know. We read books to be transported into a different world where anything can happen. Her death was dumb and served no purpose other than the shock factor.Fourth, the ending. I'm sorry but you cannot have a world so turn apart and end it so easily. Changing a view peoples minds doesn't really do much of anything. The book ended without much being done about the GPs and GDs. Yes, Chicago seemed have become some small little Utopia but Roth doesn't really explain much about how it happens and the state of the rest of the world. It all just seemed very unrealistic and rushed.In conclusion I am left feeling that a completely different author wrote this last book. The first two were incredible but this was just boring, monotone and accomplished nothing. The entire third book I felt disconnected from Tris to the point where when she died I didn't care. I honestly could barely call this a conclusion to the series since it seemed so disconnected from the other two books.

I understand why the changes in point of view were necessary, but it was still annoying.I was worried in the first half of the book that Tris' and Tobias' relationship was just going to be more of the same from the other book, with them constantly at odds with each other. Thankfully, that wasn't the case throughout the whole book.Also, with the revelations of what was going on outside the fence, everything felt a bit flat. It was almost like it took away the magic of the Divergent world, even though I was expecting it to go in that kind of direction.And now for the ending. There's no doubt it upset me, but at the same time I had to acknowledge that it was consistent with the characters' personalities. I know sometimes authors can't change character behaviour in their stories because that behaviour can almost seem beyond the author's ability to change. I think that's probably the case here. I must confess that, almost to the last moment, I was hoping for a 'Bobby Ewing' situation, but at the same time, I knew it would be a cop-out.

(Similar to my feelings on The Hunger Games Trilogy).  I was so hopeful Roth would succeed where Collins did not (for me) and make me fall back in love with the series during the final installment.Epic fail!I ordered the book on my Kindle and eagerly opened it up yesterday morning on the way to work.  I didn't get too far, but I was definitely anxious to dive back in as soon as possible.  However, curiosity got the best of me and I checked out the first ratings on Amazon.  Seeing all the one stars popping up was a huge red flag.  I paged through the reviews, spoilers and all, and I was SHOCKED to read about the ending.  Of course I opened my Kindle and read it for myself just to make sure.Honestly - I promptly returned the book.  I realize there is some disagreement over panning a book just bc you don't like the ending - but the ending of a book, especially a series/trilogy, is a huge component.  It provides closure to the reader who invested time and emotion into the characters.  While I agree that this is Roth's story and her characters - by publishing the books and selling them, I believe an author forms a relationship with the reader and owes something to her audience.  S/he needs to take their feelings into some consideration, in my opinion.  This ending felt like a complete slap in the face!I clearly can't comment in-depth on the plot, characters, and action as I only read the beginning.  What I read at first, I liked.

{"reviewTime": "03 8, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "This is my week of exploring the world of Veronica Roth, captured in the books of the Divergent trilogy.  Unfortunately, after a strong start and middle, Allegiant fell in my esteem.  The reason for this is quite simple - and not at all tied to the &#34;shocking&#34; end that had the blogosphere in an uproar (I remember seeing all of that and, having yet to pick up Divergent, just dismissed it because I didn't want a spoiler to hit me.  I wasn't spoiled, but I wasn't surprised by the ending either.)  That said, there will be a bit of spoilers happening in this review because it's the third book in the series, so don't read on if you haven't read the first two: Divergent and Insurgent.Here's where Allegiant went wrong for me.  The dual narration technique.  All this time, I've been in Tris's head.  Four has had a mystique about him and, while I still don't get the whole romance angle (except from a marketing point of view), I liked the bit of mystery.  Imagine my complete and total disappointment to find that he thinks remarkably similar to Tris.  So much so, in fact, that there were times I had to flip back to see just whose head I was currently in.  Four was nothing like I imagined him to be, and I really didn't like him that much after being there in his head.  Not at all.That said, I think Roth overstepped in Allegiant as well.  Too much in too few pages.  Too many factions vying for control weakens them all, and the story by default.  I was so confused that, by the end, I was happy to actually see something happen - although the dual perspective tipped me off from the start on what the surprise might just be.  I was so disappointed, because really... Divergent was well thought-out and put together but by the time Allegiant began to move it became sloppy and hard to keep track of.  Too many people making stupid decision, too much happening out of character (how often have you seen people step down just like that? *snaps fingers*), it just didn't make sense.  I understand that there needed to be some kind of neat, package ending all tied up with a bow but the series would have been better ending on chaos and left out there in the air, for the reader to speculate.  I hated feeling pigeon-holed into fully believing all of the really far-fetched things that were happening.So, while I thoroughly enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent, Allegiant was a dud for me.  I would recommend the series, still, because the first two books carry it (and I'm hoping the movie ends up better since we are, thankfully, free of what's inside the characters heads).

{"reviewTime": "03 28, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Where to start.....First, I've known about the series for a few years, before they decided to make into a movie. As a avid reader of paranormal romance series, I keep updated on the latest books coming out and reading the blur for Divergent I was very much intrigued until I read the first paged. 1st person... well that ended that. I wasn't going to read it. I can never sympathize with the characters when I in their head full time. I also feel that so much is missed by stilling to the 1st person POV.I heard about the movie coming out and thought awesome. I can watch the movie and not be sucked into the narrow POV. Halfway through the movie I was itching to get home so I could download the book. I was going to grit my teeth and read the 1ST Person.I devoured book within 24 hours. I loved that Tris was confused, looking to fit it, trying to hide her secret. She proves she brave herself. She fights. She beat up and bruised most the time. While Four protects her, he does not cuddle her in anyway. Four, although 18, seems more like 30, and because he aloof,a loner, a cold deadly solider, we love him more because he is vulnerable and has to hid it to survive in this world. Even though he only 2 yrs old than most of the characters and its the same age as his peers, he so much older. Mental stronger, physical perfect, that I at times picture him as cyborg with little expression.Tris was strong. She kicks ass. Her character went from shy and unsure to adult and ready to fight for good.Then I read Insurgent.....Tris loses all of her confidence. She cries all the time. Her and Four are not on the same page, emotionally, or mentally. She's reckless to the point of suicidal just because her parents have died. Her parents are dead. Ok. Sad. I get it. But Tris spent 90% of Divergent book breaking away from her parents psychically and emotionally and on many levels resigned to the fact that she may never see them again. Now, because they died she all emotional about it. Dude, the 1st book was about her being decisive and determined to make her own life as a blend of Dauntless and Abnegation.Then there is the relationship with Four/Tobias. I felt for the boy. He may be 18 but he is a man of 35. Aged. Cautious. Strong. And now he has a reckless girlfriend who can't get it together. Dauntless is looking to him to lead. I don't expect or what a prefect relationship --such things are unrealistic and boring-- but they should be on the same page. Able to fill in each other gaps. Working together. Trusting each other. There were times I was screaming &#34;Stop being 16!!!!&#34;That's what I liked in Divergent. She, for most part, didn't act like she was 16. She acted older. Determined.Then came Allegiant....WTF???????????I like the POV change between Tris and Four/Tobias. It did show Four as more a angry teenage boy who is lost and confused. But what I liked about Four was his cyborgness. I related to him in that way. Emotional disconnected much like me. I missed that he wasn't so sure of himself... But I guess that character development.*** Spoiler Alert****The whole experiment/ genetic crap was confusing as hell and I don't think it was necessary. And I spent most the time with my face scrunched up in utter disbelief that I only continued to read it just to finish it off.Half way through it I went to WIKIPEDIA and read the ploy summary, rolled my eyes and forge on.Four is NOT Divergent (What was the point of that???)The city is a scientific experiment to produce good genes ( Really?)and being watched by big brother. (dumb)Four does irrational acts that is sooooooooo not like him.Tris and Four fight....The war within the city comes to quick halt.....I can only blink at this.Tris dies.....I hoped that her selflessness would break through and Caleb would die instead, but not so. What was the point of her dying away????I felt for Four as he mourns her. I did get choked up about that.Bottom line, with the expectation of the first book, I was seriously disappointed.I really envisioned this book going in a completely different way. I saw more of a teenage urban warfare, the overtaking of a government and establishing a new one....

This third book didn't have the same grasp on my attention though.  It wasn't that it was poorly written; I was just disappointed in what was outside the gates.  Finding out what was going on outside the gates made the first two books feel pointless and since I loved  them, that was a bit heartbreaking. Between the heartbreak and my lack of interest in the explanation the third book gave, I had difficulty enjoying this book as much as the first two.Hints at potential spoilers ahead:I read other reviews that slammed the book for the conclusion. Some valid points were made but I thought the end was fitting...or fitting enough that I wasn't overly upset.  Of course, there were enough clues in the book that I knew where it was going and I was able to properly prepare myself. And though my initial reaction was that it was a sad ending, it was also hopeful in a way.  And though maybe most people would have preferred another ending (myself included), this one worked too.That said, I won't likely read this book again. There is a part in the book when Cara and Tobias are talking about how important the factions once were to her and how the government made her feel foolish for caring.  I guess I feel her pain on that one.One more note: why is this book called Allegiant if the Allegiant are such a small part of the book?", "reviewerName": "Mackenzie", "summary": "Worth reading...", "helpful": [0, 2], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1385856000, "reviewerID": "A35BW804G6U5EY"}

Of course, what DOES happen is very obvious (ANOTHER war...) and thus it's just the same as the last book (factionless vs Erudite).I DID like the ending though! Evelyn changing her colors, Tris dying, Peter wiping his memory.  It was much more interesting.The best part of this series was the secondary characters: Peter not really being bad, Marcus: an evil character but very important, Evelyn in general.

I found myself over half way through it and was asking myself when the action was going to start. How do you make Tobias a wimp in the last book when he has always shown what a strong character he is. How do you end up killing off Tris and letting all the bad guys stay alive. How do you write 2 books that are so intense and exciting that you just can't put them down and then end up with this last book and have it all fall apart. No suspense. No excitement.  Just depression at the end. Perhaps, if you were tired and just did not have the material to complete the series, you could have just waited.  I know that I would have been more than happy to wait for a better book with a better ending. Because of the way this book ended, I wish I had never started the series.

I liked where the second book left off and obviously I was excited to see how it all ended. There&#8217;s obviously been quite a bit of controversy about the ending, and as I said no spoilers, but I will say that I was surprised and wouldn&#8217;t use the word &#8220;like&#8221; but I respected the ending. I also know that this book took a while to come together and was a bit of a disaster for a while and honestly, I totally got that while reading, but I was also influenced by that going in.But let&#8217;s skip back a little. When the story starts Tris is imprisoned by the new government, run by Four&#8217;s mother, waiting to figure out if she can go free or not. Eventually she&#8217;s obviously freed and even though the factions have been abolished there are still a lot of problems. A group called the Allegiant forms whose aim is to bring back the old faction system and also explore what Edith Prior meant when she said they needed to leave the city and help repopulate society. The Allegiant recruits Tris, even though she&#8217;s not sure what she wants, and a group, including Tori, Four, Christina, Uriah, and Peter leave the city to go in search of what else is out there.I actually really liked what they found when they left city boundaries, although I thought it could have been developed a little more, I was left with some questions at the end. But I thought the explanation of how the factions and their world came to be was really interesting and, as disturbing as the whole thing was, I really did believe it could (mostly) be true. Which is what I think makes dystopian books either good or bad&#8211;you have to be able to buy into what you&#8217;re reading as possibly being able to be true.My biggest issue with the book was the length. It was just so long, but somehow felt like not much happened. Even know when I&#8217;m writing this review, I&#8217;m trying to recall what happened and pretty much I have Tris released, they leave the city, discover what&#8217;s in the world, try to figure out what they want to do next. The story never dragged, but I still think it could have been made considerably shorter and tightened up, as well.Bottom Line: This wasn&#8217;t a completely satisfying finish to the story for me. I wish Veronica Roth could have ended it as well as she started it, but I didn&#8217;t dislike it and part of me respects that she was able to do what she did.

It didn't leave me feeling &#34;dead&#34; inside like some reviews said. And it didn't leave me asking &#34;Okay... what now?&#34;I'm sad at the way it ended, but satisfied enough to not feel empty.I think to each their own -- when it comes to books, and reviews are always about the negative or bothersome things in a book. I thought this book deserved a good rating, from someone who is picky about their books.I wasn't sure I was going to like this series, but I ended up falling in love with it. And I would happy re-read this book without hesitation the 2nd time around.Give the book a try before deciding you just aren't going to read it because of some of these reviews.

I want to start off by saying that Veronica Roth is a wonderful writer.  I felt every emotion the characters felt. I loved the fact that. Roth allowed them to have feelings and thoughts way beyond their teenage years. Roth forces the reader to understand that, despite their young age, the world is so different and these kids have had to grow up fast. As an adult I appreciate this and can relate to it. I love the love between Tris and Tobias...its perfect first love chemistry and emotion. But its also real enough for readers of any age to relate to.Now my critique ...SPOILERS AHEAD!I think the main plot (besides the love) lost its credibility and edge with the addition of so many sub plot conspiracies.  I get that once the group left the city they had to encounter conflict...but to find another war (gd vs gp)  within a war...just made me lose interest. I didn't care for Nita and did not see the point to her character. And David...I felt like I didn't know enough about him to understand the obsession behind his motives.  If he loved Tris mother so much that should have been the focus of his life mission to destroy Tris..or to save her.Caleb...he would have never accepted to sacrifice his life. I just didn't believe it. Same with Evelyn. She  hadn't been a mother in years, didn't think twice about her son during the war but all of a sudden she'll quit the life of endless power and ambition after ONE conversation?  I don't buy it. Same with Marcus.And of course Tris ' death. I understand why she had to die but the way she died was ridiculous.  After all those life threatening ordeals she went through,  2 random shots by a guy in a wheelchair kill her? And the fact that it was all in vain ...besides her friends, nobody else seemed to care?  And her last words for. Tobias...just the whole thing seem rushed. She deserved better...all her sacrifice,pain and loss should have been rewarded. She deserved a happy ending.  If not happy, than she should have given her life for Tobias or Cristina. That would have made everything come together.Overall, the series is brilliant and I loved ever minute of it.

I didn't plow through the book by any means, but instead read it over the course of about two months.Over those two months, I have to say my final review of the book is mediocre. Allegiant as a stand alone book MAY be okay - but as the third book in conclusion of a series? Not okay.First, the way the book is written is disorienting and confusing. Roth switched back and forth between Tris and Tobias' perspectives. Since I read the book over two months, however, this proved more confusing than interesting. At times I read Tobias thinking that it were Tris - and other times I read Tris thinking it were Tobias. I couldn't enjoy the plot.That brings to the second point - the plot. Like I said - the plot MAY have been a good standalone plot. Allegiant's plot, though, is incredibly different than the first two books. Essentially, furthermore, the nature of the plot semi-disregards the plot of the first two. All of a sudden the plot of Divergent and Insurgent don't matter in Allegiant - they'r just the &#34;things of the past.&#34; This was sad to see, because I feel Roth worked very hard to develop that world and conflict.I will not go into plot holes or mistakes I believe Roth made.

{"reviewTime": "11 4, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I loved the first 2 books in the \"Divergent\"series. The story kept me engaged and I loved the characters - Tris, Four, Uriah, Christina, and their group of friends - as well as the world that Veronica Roth created.My question for Veronica Roth on \"Allegiant\" is - WHY?????????** SPOILERS **Why does this third book change so drastically with no relation to the plotlines, premise and characterizations that you built up in \"Divergent\" and \"Insurgent\"? Why did you write such an empty, hollow story and in such a way that completely severed the audience's emotional connection to characters that they have loved?I could go on and on, but other readers have already said what I would like to say: \"disappointing,\" \"hollow, \" left you drained,\" \"ending has no sense of hope,\" \"non-sensical deaths,\" \"empty,\" \"boring,\" \"devoid of emotional ties and connection.\" I agree with other readers who indicate that they felt betrayed by Roth. I felt that as well and it is such a shame that the two books that I have loved are now completely damaged by this third, non-sensical conclusion to the story. I wish Veronica Roth made different choices to this book. The way the author set up the two narrative voices of Tris and Four (and flipped back and forth between them on EVERY - yes, EVERY - other chapter) just made it impossible for the audience to develop an emotional connection to the characters and the story. Did she really need to shift back and forth so often - too often that jarred the reader at every turn and prevented us from feeling continuity in the story and the character's point of view? In addition, this process made Tobias' thoughts too exposed. Any good fiction writer with a female protagonist understands that the male (romantic) protagonist always has to leave a sense of mystery in the eyes of his love interest. Even Stephenie Meyer understood this on the \"Twilight\" series. While we knew Jacob's thoughts, Edward's was often a mystery. Knowing Four's every thought and word diminished this sense of mystery. Four's character was also altered from a strong, protective, authoritative figure to a petulant, weak young man. I loved Tobias in books 1 and 2 but he ends up a battered and unrecognizable character in this one. And let me not even start with Tris. What Roth did with Tris was non-sensical in my eyes.I wish she decided to continue where she left off - continued with the characters and portrayals that she built; continued with the premise and plotlines that she created and developed and that the fans loved in the first two books; and fulfilled the destiny that was meant for Tris and Four - working together to rebuild the societies that have fallen apart (whether in Chicago or outside the wall) and mend the broken relationships with friends and family around them. Not like this. I did not expect this. I am upset, confused and angry about what she did with Tris and Four and how she ended this story.My final advice to anyone who is curious about how the story ends. Don't bother. Ignorance is bliss. You are better off just reading books 1 and 2. This book has ruined the series for me. I felt emotionally drained and empty. Angry. Devoid of feeling for the characters or the story by the time it ended. There is nothing in this book that gives audiences a semblance of hope or felt uplifting. Veronica Roth has not learned what Suzanne Collins, JK Rowling, JRR Tolkien, Jane Austen and many other successful and loved authors before her knew - that even with all the trials and tribulations that the hero or heroine go through in their journey, the ending has to lift the audience up and provide a sense of hope for the main lead(s). Harry Potter lost friends and family on his path to become a great wizard and beating Voldemort, but he survived and will rebuild with his best friends Hermione and Ron beside him. Katniss and Peeta may have gone through hell and back in the \"Hunger Games\" series - but in the end they will heal together. Frodo goes off with Gandalf, Bilbo and the elder elves to the Undying Lands while Sam, Merry and Pippin live on and raise families and Aragorn fulfills his destiny as King of Gondor in \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Elizabeth Bennett marries Mr. Darcy in \"Pride & Prejudice.\" And yet, here, Veronica Roth decides to rip the hearts of the audience apart and  leaves a torn Tobias and uncertain future for the very few left in the story.What a waste of an opportunity to end the story in a way that remains faithful to the spirit of the first two books. No thanks to Veronica Roth for ruining the series. This is going to be the first time where I hope Hollywood makes A LOT of changes when (if) they eventually make the 3rd film. Because at this point, nobody will want to watch this movie when it makes its way to the theaters. I know I won't.", "reviewerName": "Marcy G. \"MarcyG\"", "summary": "I feel cheated.

I like it that (SPOILER) Tris died at the end.  It was obviously sad, but it was real.  I'm sick of books that everything is perfect for the heroine/hero and only minor characters die.  That's not the real world.  Yes, it's a book and it's fun to dream about things being rosy-posy, but that becomes cheesy and fake.  Up until about 2/3 through the book, I was expecting there to be a love triangle between Tobias-Tris-Mathew.  I figured that Tobias would die, and Tris would end up with Mathew, thus avoiding any real choice being made.  It dawned on me that perhaps Tris would die, not one of the guys, and I became more interested.2.  I like it that Tris and Tobias had a real relationship.  It was full of ups and downs, highs and lows; just like in our everyday lives.  It was full of depth and wasn't superficial (like Edward and Bella... ugh).  I like it that she was close to breaking up with Tobias, but chose not to.3.  I liked how many references there were to the world we live in.  All the uprisings reminded me of countries with constant political conflict and the US's relationship to them.  The constant replacement of one dictator for another was accurate.  I also appreciated the lower-class GDs.  The GPs' perception of them was similar to whites and blacks.4.  I like the way the sex scene was handled.  It's very tricky with YA books to have premarital, unprotected sex.  Many books don't even go there (e.g., Delirium, Matched), so it was realistic to have a hero/heroine do this.5.  The general depth of the characters was refreshing.  I liked being attached to more than one character.&lt;b>Things that got a little annoying:&lt;/b>1.  There were a few grammatical errors and editing issues that made it awkward. For example, the lack of commas when describing who felt what became confusing.2.  The constant emotional feeling between Tris and Tobias.  I get it that they're deeply in love, but we don't need to constantly read about how every time they kiss it's like puzzle pieces fitting together and they can't keep their hands off each other.&lt;b>Final thoughts:&lt;/b>For a young adult book, this is very well-written and engaging.

So utterly pointless.(and I will not contain my grief.)Here I thought Delirium series has a disgruntling ending. Congratulations to Divergent series for having the most illogical, senseless, and f***** up ending to date.*throws knives instead of confetti*When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ended, I was choking with tears. When The Reapers Are the Angels ended, I was ten times inconsolable. At least the grief for these two books was warranted. The deaths were not necessary, but it somehow embodied that the loss of life will contribute more on the lives of the people they left behind.That was so not the case for Allegiant. My buckets of tears were from anger, disbelief and outright dubiousness of a death that was obviously contrived just so this sacrifice can be as tangible as it gets for the readers.Well, f*** sacrifice. F*** selflessness.Are these two traits only measurable by death?Heroism only identified when life is offered willingly?I don&#8217;t think so!I did not mind that the plot is ridden with holes, or the story is outlandishly veering off from the dystopian theme (and straight to a sci-fi one), or characters did not leave the same hard imprint that the story implied (Who is Edward again? Or Tori? I cannot even remember George Wu!). I no longer cared as much about these elements, so long as Tris and Four get the fruits of their triumphs, whatever they maybe.But I was denied that. Fully, truly denied of that.Without it, I asked myself: &#8220;WTF am I reading this for?!!!&#8221;It&#8217;s been two days since I finished Allegiant, and I think it would take more days for my anger to subside. The madness brought about by its ending is nowhere near dissipating.I remembered I hated that time when GRRM killed a main character after building him so succinctly in A Game of Thrones. I finished three books already in ASoIaF series, and I still question that death. I still question, and yet I understand more now of why it is necessary.Veronica Roth killing one of her characters in Allegiant is a far cry from that. Not even a whimper.The term Allegiant was just a d&eacute;cor. Because when Tris and her friends went outside for the first time, there is a new uprising waiting for them that they can join. But now, it is between genetically pure (GPs) or genetically damaged (GDs). The conflict between the factions and factionless is still spiking, but Roth has to introduce another set of conflict for Tris. Gah, it never ends.So when the war between the factions and factionless reached its peak, the people watching from the outside (Department of Genetic Welfare) decided to act. But it was an abominable plan to Tris. But wait&#8230; in order to prevent them, Tris thought to do that same horrific deed (she abhorred) to the originators of the plan. What?! How&#8217;s that for a solution?!! The morality that Tris was asking for was so two-faced, even Four called her on that. But Tris told him, &#8220;let&#8217;s choose the lesser evil.&#8221; And Four reluctantly agreed. WTF.Looking back, I realized that Four&#8217;s POV being present in Allegiant was a letdown. I did not see the Dauntless legend, the stern and disciplined Dauntless instructor who can whip his initiates into submission. Peter even manhandled him for a while in this finale! Four was insecure, unstable, and still reeling from hurt because he cannot have the love from either of his parents. *sigh* It was sad, really. But I love you, Four. Always have, always will.Tris is stronger, wiser, and better equipped to deal with issues than Four. Her character was still developing, progressing into this heroine worthy from a dystopian world.

Edith Prior&#8217;s news of what is outside the city walls has the remaining factions and factionless unsure of what to do. With Tobias&#8217;s mother stepping up as leader, the city is doomed to face another tyrannical government. Luckily, the Allegiant is formed. Tris, Tobias, and other friends join and face the world outside the city they grew up in. They never knew how big the world was until they stepped outside. Being outside the city is not what they expect. Government manipulations, damaged genes, experiments, and lots more await these brave young adults.Narration: First person through Tris and TobiasCharacter Development: With Tobias narrating in first person, the reader can understand what is going on in his mind much better compared to the other books. Through this, we see that Tobias has more weaknesses and doubts than we previously thought. His thoughts reveal his reliance on Tris, his anxieties over his parents, and how he handles the consequences of his actions. He is still strong but now the reader can see the little niches that make him human.Throughout the book we see Tris grow as a person. She tackles with her brother&#8217;s betrayal, the fear of still holding a gun, learning who to trust, and how to make her relationship work with Tobias. Each character has to face their past and their fears. They are thrown into world outside their comfort zone &#8211; a world where there are no factions. A world where divergent is not some weird trait, and those that are considered divergent might not really be a true divergent.Plot Development/Flow: The story moved along well. I kind of wish it was given a year of some sorts in the mix of everything (just to gain a little baring while reading it.) The story is obviously set in the future, but it could really be close to the present.At first I would periodically confuse myself with who was narrating. The other two books where entirely done by Tris, so I would naturally keep reading in that mindset instead of Tobias&#8217;s. The more I read into the book, the easier it became. I can understand the purpose of the two views, especially near the end. It would have been impossible to include everything if it was just Tris&#8217;s view.Standalone or Part of a Series: Last book in the Divergent Series", "reviewerName": "Maria", "summary": "Review for Allegiant", "helpful": [0, 1], "overall": 4.0, "unixReviewTime": 1396396800, "reviewerID": "AURN9JB68E1FM"}

First and foremost, she needs to understand that this is the entertainment industry. People want to be entertained, not depressed. It is all about being able to write exactly what you want to convey you message and then sell that product to prospective readers.  Second, she needs to develop a better grasp of her target market and write to that target's expectations, thus building a loyal following of readers.  I think this book has damaged the loyalty built in the first two books.  I've read several comments that at book signings she failed to listen to what her audience has been saying.  And these are people which specifically came to see her.  Lastly, IT IS her prerogative to tell the story the way she wants to.  Although this is true, I will caution that there are ramifications to exercising that freedom, and deviating from the expectations of the target market.  This is exactly the reason why the Dixie Chicks fell from the top of the country music charts.  Their music was top notch, but what they chose to say and do (their entitled rights) outside of their music directly alienated Nashville and most country music fans. Accordingly, as is the audience's prerogative, everyone turned them off.I believe she owes us an explanation (and maybe even a re-write). There is so much more she could have done. She at least had the opportunity to put Tobias and Christina together 2 years later, but chose not to do so.  That would have at least invoked a better appearance of healing.Added to the Review... It was not realistic to me that David had the actual abilities to actually kill Tris (as opposed to just sheer dumb luck).  First, David was a high level administrator, not a dauntless trained \"killer\"/soldier. He is used to subordinates executing his instructions. No where in the story leads us to believe that David had ever fired a weapon himself (at least not in the book's storyline).  He was wounded and had limited mobility in the wheelchair.  Plus he was fully aware that Tris was a recently and deadly trained soldier (creating an extremely tense situation).  There are countless articles available where trained police officers fire massive number of rounds in a stressful \"firefight\" conditions without hitting their targets, but we are expected to believe that David can fire and hit twice with deadly accuracy.  Second, if we are to believe Tris is as smart, resourceful and well trained, then her believable course of action once confronted would have been to evade, maneuver and disarm David, maybe getting wounded in the process, but not just making herself a silhouetted inviting target.", "reviewerName": "Mark Brooks", "summary": "There are some lessons to be learned.", "helpful": [6, 16], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1382572800, "reviewerID": "A1DO8T1NU96AF0"}

I appreciate the social implications of the &#34;factions&#34; & the faction-less. I am sure the groupings ring true for many trying to find their way in a fragmented world. This 3rd book provides a history of how this faction-ed society came about and gives a resolution on how it ultimately is dealt with. The series is dark and rather shallow. It delivers a hopeless old message; knives and guns, weapons, bombs, bigger guns, and manipulation are the only means to reach the goal of securing power over everyone else, so you can then survive to fight more--and more--and more. I've notice quite a few books recently that are delivering the same message, that the only hope for the younger generation is to take up the tools of the older warring generations to deal with human conflict. The Hunger Games series (the books) has a message that challenges the idea that war, class divisions, revenge, or bigger weapons could ever be the answer to bringing about a just society or real peace. The Divergent series lacks that depth.", "reviewerName": "Mary", "summary": "ok way to sum up a so-so trilogy", "helpful": [1, 2], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1397692800, "reviewerID": "A1055OPF8GMYA6"}
{"reviewTime": "03 27, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I believe people have some very good reasons for not liking the series ending, but personally, this book was my favorite of all three.  However, I didn't read Allegiant until several months after it was released and, by that point, there had been a big enough media storm about the ending that I had some inkling it wouldn't be quite what I was expecting.  I think if you read this book as it is, and not what &#34;it could have been&#34; or &#34;should have been,&#34; you'll find that it's really quite good.Main piece of advice:  LISTEN TO THE AUDIOBOOK-  From what I've seen in most other reviews, people have had trouble telling the difference between the narrations of Tobias and Tris.  I read the story via audiobook with different narrators for each part, so I wasn't even aware this was a problem until I read what other people have been saying.  While their narrations in the book may be similar, their actual personalities (i.e. their desires, their fears, their purpose) were very distinct to me through the audiobook.  I'd recommend giving audiobooks a try it if this is your first time reading the book :)From this point on, my review may contain spoilers (but I'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible).  Also, this review is STRICTLY my opinion.  I'm not saying other criticisms are invalid or that my opinion is better than others.  This review is only a reflection of my experience with Allegiant.Loved:- The natural, efficient flow of eventsPersonally, I felt like every event naturally led to the next event.  Everything seemed to contribute to the story and not a word was wasted.  More importantly, I admired how EFFICIENT the flow was.  For example, Roth opened many of her chapters with a conversation.  This method skips over any extra detail of &#34;later that evening, they all met in the kitchen...&#34;  It's a great 'cut-to-the-chase' technique.  While the story was a little slower outside the fence, I never felt bogged down in the details.  Roth moved from scene to scene smoothly, with just the right amount of detail to convey descriptions and emotions.- The writingIn my opinion, the writing was very well done.  Perhaps the audiobook narrators added to this effect or perhaps I've just read quite a few YA books that are not well-written, but I'm choosing to believe that Veronica Roth is a great writer.  I even think she's improved over the series, and I'm interested in seeing where her skills go from here.- The character developmentLike I mentioned earlier, Tris and Tobias felt very distinct to me.  From the beginning of this series, there has always been a struggle with identity for these two characters.  Allegiant was no different in exploring this struggle, particularly with Tobias.-  No &#34;mushy&#34; stuff (for lack of a better word)This isn't really a new thing, but I really appreciate how Roth keeps the romance honest and real.  I feel like Tobias and Tris's relationship go beyond passion and puppy eyes, and it's quite refreshing to me.My Criticisms:- Outside the fenceI loved the cliffhanger that Insurgent left us with, but I was worried how it was going to work out.  What kind of world was going to be outside the fence?  It almost seemed too drastic of a change to add right before the series finale.  In my opinion, the last book is NOT where you want to be throwing in a whole new world.  HOWEVER, I was pleased with what Roth did with the world outside the fence.  It wasn't as drastic as I feared.  Really, the main downside was that being outside the fence meant being outside the action of the rebellion going on within the city.- What about a different choice?Earlier I mentioned that I felt like the events flowed naturally, and, for all intents and purposes, they did.  Each choice had a fitting consequence.  However, that doesn't mean it was the best plan the characters could come up with.  There were some instances where I felt like the characters were overlooking some of their better options.  Even though there may have been some holes in the decision making (and therefore the plot), it doesn't mean that the story didn't wrap up nicely.  Personally, I still enjoyed how everything worked out.Anyways, I'd recommend reading this book, mostly if you want to see how the series end.  Although, definitely try buying it as an audiobook, because it seems like that might be the better choice of mediums.  Overall, I wouldn't judge the book by its ratings.

{"reviewTime": "10 25, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Possible spoilers:I was pre-spoiled for the ending by reading here.  I was very upset about the ending after reading the reviews.  The ending (after reading it) didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.  It was sad but beautifully so.  What does bother me is how much this ending ruined the series for me.  I can not enjoy this couple who were set up as soulmates thinking about how they were separated and what was lost.  I find it hard to accept that Tobias left her to deal with the situation that led to her death alone.  He had an obligation to Uriah's family, but honestly, any of his friends could have gone to fetch them, and he could have made his confession later.  I find it hard to believe that Tris' sacrifice was unforseeable from Tobias' perspective.  I have a problem with Tobias' lack of insight throughout this particular book (whether it comes to Tris' intuition being right, Tris being likely to take her brother' s place, his relationship with Evelyn [carried over from Insurgent] or being tricked by Nita).We saw this same ending in Insurgent but with a different outcome, and the sacrifice that Tris made in Insurgent made a lot more sense (preventing the loss of innocent life).  She had a symbolic death and resurrection.  There was a completeness about that \"death\" that made this sacrifice seem like an epilogue.  It paled in comparison to the one in Insurgent even though her motivation was more selfless vs. reckless this time.Tris and Tobias' morality is all over the place in Allegiant.  They break Caleb out of custody because he's Tris' brother, but Caleb was a co-conspirator in events that led to the deaths of hundreds of people and deserved to stay in custody.  Many reviews have criticized the morality of being ok with erasing memories of the government workers to prevent the erasing of the memories of the factioned/factionless/Allegiant society.Re: Romance.  It feels very unconsummated although their last scene together was somewhat ambiguous.  I thought for sure we would have a real emotional climax moment in this book if not a HEA.My biggest issue with the romance, however, is that the ending made Evelyn right when she said that Tris was only temporary and that she, Evelyn, was permanent.  This is just awful if you love this couple and have been a loyal fan of the series.Re: Genetically damaged (GD) vs. Genetically pure (GP): We spent two books with the factioned society, and it was pretty clear that these were folks segregated based on personality rather than genetics.  They didn't live up to their factions because they were made that way...They struggled to keep their anti-faction tendencies under control, either with sheer will or peace serum.I also felt the GD/GP conflict seemed contrived to keep Tobias in a state of unease and self doubt and reinforce the fact that Tris was unique and he was not.  You have to ignore many things that happened in the first two books to be able to accept this.My biggest issue with the POV shifting (other than having to page back about 8 times on Kindle) is the loss of Tris' narrative voice.  I felt doubly deprived by Tris' death because I lost the enjoyment of her voice for 1/2 of this novel.", "reviewerName": "Mary Lind \"Suzymom1\"", "summary": "Didn't live up to the promise of Divergent and Insurgent", "helpful": [13, 13], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1382659200, "reviewerID": "A1GYIXGOOF6OYG"}

If the critical reception of this third rather dull and sloppy book does not completely blow her confidence, I expect she will grow as a writer and will hopefully learn that structure, planning and careful editing can make all the difference.

Tolkien was 33 when he wrote The Hobbit and started on the Lord of the Rings trilogy; married and well on in his academic career, he, too, had had an eventful life, surviving the trenches of World War 1 but losing all but one of his close friends to conflict.Truth be told very few authors produce much more than half-baked drivel in their 20's.

I certainly will give her next book a chance.I also have secret hopes that the movie will iron out some of the flaws in Divergent (not perfect, even though it was the best of the three).

{"reviewTime": "03 7, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I can easily say this is my least favorite in the trilogy. It started out awjward. Not because of the writing. I think Veronica Roth is a very talented writer. At first, I did not understand the sudden POV shift change from just Tris to Tris & Tobias and at first it was confusing. I was so used to it being only Tris that I would start reading a Tobias chapter thinking it was Tris and be like, O.o until I figured it out. I did get used to it though eventually, a few chapters down the road.The storyline was kind of a letdown. I wanted the Divergent to be something more than they were I guess. Not just normal people. But, I know this is dystopian and in these worlds things are more bad than good and that&#8217;s just the way it is otherwise it's utopian. Still. If this were a standalone book and not related to the Divergent series at all, I probably would have liked this storyline better if that makes sense.Let&#8217;s talk about the characters. I liked most of the new characters, save Nita. I thought she was an idiot and HATED that Four followed her stupid plan and the destruction it caused. I really liked Matthew. Great addition. Tobias/Four, I&#8217;m sorry, I fell in love with him in the first two books, but he was a little whiny in this one. There is a fine line between broody and whiny and he crossed it. His relationship with Tris did get a little tiring with all the back and forth fighting.Evelyn threw down arms a little too quickly for me there at the end. &#8220;Hey mom, could you go make peace?&#8221; &#8220;Anything for you son.&#8221; Bam! Done. Really? After years of planning a Factionless rebellion, and hate and vengeance growing deep inside her for her husband, she&#8217;s just going to roll over that quickly? No. Yes, it goes along with the plot, I understand, but, sigh, for me it didn&#8217;t seem very realistic (yes, I know it's fiction, but still it needs to seem authentic).Now let&#8217;s discuss the &#8220;shocker.&#8221; I get it. I do. Stuff happens. The world isn&#8217;t perfect. Selflessness. Courage. Sacrifice for those you love. The greater good. Yeah. It didn&#8217;t have to be Tris. That really could have been Caleb&#8217;s great moment of redemption. Or she could have done all that and survived it. She died of GUNSHOT WOUNDS for God&#8217;s sake. Not even from the death serum.

Veronica, I feel betrayed!!!Here&#8217;s what it comes down to for me: I loved books 1 & 2 in this series.

Clear and concise when she doesn&#8217;t.Her characters are well developed, interesting, and unique. It is easy for me to picture them in my head and I&#8217;m in love with Four. Well the Four from books 1 & 2, not so much this book.It is the 3rd book in a series in which the first 2 books won me over. Very good escapism.Minuses:As part of the series, I was disappointed in the plot. If this would have been a standalone and not related to the series, I think I would have enjoyed it much more.The shift of POV from the first 2 books was problematic for me at first, until I got used to it.

In the previous two books, Roth has created an engaging and dynamic world which has recently been upended by a great revelation. Allegiant sadly does not do justice to what should have been a climactic finale. Here is what went wrong:The two viewpoints where essentially the same: We see the story from both Tris and Tobias'  point of view in this novel. The trouble is, Roth does nothing make the characters different; if it weren't for the chapter headings you would not know who was speaking. Their thoughts and manner of thinking are virtually identical, and their personalities get muffled by the writing which comes across as a tad immature. In other works, multiple viewpoints often enhance the story and allow you to see the situation from multiple perspectives and get inside different people's heads. Tris and Tobias may as well be one in the same.The writing was subpar: I feel like an entirely different Veronica Roth wrote this book. The writing became immature and the plot lost its intrigue quite quickly. I felt as though a teenage shadow-writer was behind this book, as it was the sort of writing one might find in a high school english class attempting to write a Twilight-style novel. While the novels have always been told through the eyes of teens, the writing has felt like that of an adult up until this point. I was left frustrated by the sudden deterioration of quality.The ending: No spoilers I promise. But I can think of a million better ways to end this series which would have achieved effectively the same outcome without the reader feeling disheartened and like they just wasted several hours of their life.Do yourself a favor.

I found the last book (Allegiant) to be OK, although it suffers from the same flaws that keep the other books from being great.  I'll try to summarize them briefly:1. A general lack of characterization:  Almost all of the characters are interchangeable.  I kept having to remind myself who characters were as I was reading which kept me from getting emotionally connected to the story.  This was extremely problematic in Allegiant because this book is told from the perspective of both Tris and Tobias.  Honestly, I couldn't tell them apart except for the chapter headings.2. Plot is shallow:  These characters make all kinds of secret plans, then discuss them in very public areas and are never overheard.  Then they invite strangers into their conspiracy, and the strangers just go along with their plans rather than turning them in.  The plans themselves are juvenile at best.  I can suspend belief for the sake of  the story, but eventually I just can't get myself to feel the tension when the plot is hanging by a shoe string.I'm not sorry I read the book--I'm glad to know how the story ends, but I'm pretty sure that as soon as I click submit on this review, I'll forget about it.", "reviewerName": "Melissa Davis \"Missy\"", "summary": "Mildly entertaining but ultimately forgetful", "helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1388707200, "reviewerID": "A2IOCLQTRV8MYT"}

{"reviewTime": "10 25, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Update 10/26 -- Well, after sleeping on this one for a day I think I'm going to drop my rating to three stars. I still feel the same way about the ending, although with time, instead of feeling more at peace with it I think that I am more disappointed in it. I really do think that Veronica Roth could have gone in a different direction that could have been just as gritty and harsh, but a direction that could have at least rewarded the readers for sticking with Tris and Tobias for three books. After all, we read to escape reality or to discover something deeper about who we are or about humanity in general. I'm not sure the ending to this series managed to accomplish that. Still, I do recognize the bravery of an author in deciding to go this way. But ... the reason that I need to drop this rating a star is because I spent some time really thinking about the themes and issues that were set up initially in the opening book of this series. These issues were never really addressed. They were dropped as new issues arose in book two. And then in book three we get a whole new set of issues. For continuity sake I feel as if the author dropped the ball in favor of a more soap opera dilemma-of-the-week approach that weakens the overall series. The characters are weaker as less time is spent on them and their individual struggles and more time is spent on the newest danger that Roth throws at them. So, anyway, I don't fall into the camp of die-hard haters out there that are spending their days trolling the amazon reviews and marking all the four and five star reviews as unhelpful while they publicly throw giant fits about the ending. But I also don't fall into the \"this is the best book ever\" camp either. It is not. I am somewhere in between. I see some value in the issues brought up in this final story, but I think that the execution of the entire series ultimately ended up falling flat after a solid beginning. Here's my initial review:Well, I'll say this ... Veronica Roth is one brave author. I can't really say why without majorly spoiling this book, but (man oh man!) that ending! There are going to be a lot of Divergent fans who are seriously angry about the way this trilogy ends. A lot. I can totally understand where those feelings would come from. I, however, can appreciate the choice that Roth makes in writing the events of this story. I don't necessarily like them, but I can appreciate them. And that is all that I can say without revealing too much. Just be prepared for a good dose of reality ... sometimes happy endings require sacrifice, and sometimes that sacrifice sucks ... big time!This conclusion to the Divergent trilogy is a good one. I did not re-read the first two books before I started this one, but I wish that I had. I think if the events of those books were clearer in my mind I could have appreciated a lot more of the nuanced dilemmas that crept up in this story. The alliances and motivations that guided so many people for the first two books had changed and become confusing in those stories, and so, because I did not have those stories fresh in my mind, I was having a bit of difficulty remembering who I was supposed to be trusting and who I was supposed to be angry with. I eventually remembered everything, but I do wish that I had taken the time to refresh my memory before reading. It would have made the first half of the book more enjoyable for me.Things I liked:The themes presented in this book. We finally get to figure out exactly who is pulling the strings in this new Chicago reality and what motivates the government. It is pretty creepy. In some ways I felt like it was a demented episode of The Truman Show. Creepy. There is the theme of the problem that comes about when those in authority take it upon themselves to manipulate others for \"the common good.\" What is that exactly, and is it ever okay to take away someone's autonomy or freedom to protect it? There is a huge theme involving genetic research. Who are we when we discover that our genes are not \"optimal?\" Do our genes make us who we are or are we a product of our life experiences? So many fascinating things to thing about, and I love it when a book makes me think about my own world and my role in it.Tris. The tough, altruistic girl of the first book is back for this one. She has some seriously difficult choices to make. Seeing her make them in this book made me want to go back and re-read the first book, just so I could see her evolution from the very beginning. Love her!Tobias. Sigh. I don't know what to say. I adore this character and all of his layered personality. All I can give him is another sigh. I will always remember the way he ends this book in the epilogue. Perfect! Long live Four and all he stands for!Making the difficult choices. I began this review by stating that Veronica Roth is a brave author for the choices she made in writing this book. This doesn't just go for her. Her characters also have to make tough choices throughout this book. Tris. Caleb. Tobias. Peter. Matthew. Evelyn. Cara. Christina. All of them. Sometimes the choices end up well. Sometimes the choices make things even harder. But they make those choices, and I loved the bravery they showed by making them.So, this is a book that may end up thrown across a lot of bedroom walls when the ending arrives. Be prepared for that. But also be prepared for a beautiful story of a people overcoming great odds to find some degree of autonomy and happiness in an incredibly messed up world.

{"reviewTime": "04 13, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "How to start a review about this book? Well let's just say it felt like an awful piece of fan fiction, and I'm a fan fiction junkie, but there's good ffic, and then theres the one that resembles this.First main problem, the book is written from Tris AND Tobias point of view. You don't switch your narrator on the THIRD book from a series, you just don't; it's like a cheap way to desperately please the fans. I don't know why Roth did it, maybe she liked Four so much she wanted to share him more, but this was not the way to do it. Besides, it presented him in such a different way, he was just a shadow of the man he was on the first book.I wanted so much to like this book, despite everything on the internet, I thought they were just haters ( like on The Hunger Games, the third book got a lot of hate, and yet I loved it) but oh my, weren't the haters right.So it turns out they were just an experiment, the real world was happening, and they were just living there like lab rats, I mean can you imagine finding out everything you knew was invented by some people running trials on you? This is why it felt like fan fiction. Most of us book lovers, fall in love with characters more often than not, and it's not so hard to try an imagine how our favorite characters would be like in our everyday lives, you know, our not epic routines, filled with Netflix binge watching and mundane jobs. There's a reason they live in their own world, they are just weird and out of place people if you take their fantasy land away, all of a sudden, Tris was not the special center of the universe anymore, she was literally just a girl who didn't know nothing and risked her life for a bunch of lies. It's a fun literary exercise to imagine your extraordinary character in your ordinary life, but after this, not sure it's good best-seller material.To make it all worse, Tris didn't just loose her world, she lost her &#34;main character status&#34;, she was now sharing with her boyfriend, and ultimately she also (view spoiler)The character development I was expecting just didn't happen. Peter made a bunch of snide clever comments, and BIG decisions that were never explained. Caleb just sort of became good again (I now believe he's the one the book owes the most, he went from being perfect to awful to kind of hated to loved without any sort of sensible line or just plain sense)The book felt all over the place, it wanted to deal with genetics, propaganda, deceit, love and it just never came together. I found myself just skipping lines at the end.By the way, Tris was the one I was following, not Tobias. I felt cheated out of the mind of my trusted narrator just to hear from some guy that didn't resemble who I had come to known in two previous books.I give it two stars out of respect for my previously beloved characters; the rest of the book just left me disappointed.", "reviewerName": "melissa platt", "summary": "Was the writer in a rush? on a Fan Fiction site?

{"reviewTime": "10 24, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "This is a Spoiler free but Detailed Review of Allegiant.I never was a fan of this trilogy but I wanted to finish it to see how it will all end up and it was poorly wrapped up and a slap in the face to people who are fans.In all honesty this was not good at all. It was Boring. It took way too long to get to the point and to be honest except the very end, far too much was EASY for the characters. Up until the end of the book, there was really no challenge. Anything they did they more or less got away with.1. Plot & WritingThis book continues off of the events of Insurgent where Tris has revealed the recording of Edith Prior and the people are now being held against their will by Tobias' Four mother.You would have thought after the events of Book 2 that Book 3 would more or less be adrenaline rushed and non-stop.WRONG....For about the first 20 or so chapters of the book, the book is a bit slow. Yeah there are a few action scenes or intense scenes but for nearly 1/3 of the book it is mainly Tris & Four just sitting around talking.  Talking about their relationship, talking about the plans of what they are going to do, talking about this, talking about that.It was boring to be honest. This is mean to be the final book...you are supposed to go out with a bang and let it be non-stop where the book barely gives you a chance to breathe...Instead, I got bored quite a bit and did the skim reading thing.But then if the first 1/3- 1/2 of the book was slow, then last 1/2 was a bit too rushed. The ending of the book was sort of anti-climatic in a way and I can see why so many people are pissed with the ending. I would be pissed as well if I was a die hard fan. Too much time was spent focused on a less important plot that the biggest shocker of all sort of is just glazed over and I was like...Really? That's how you want to end it.I will say what i enjoyed about this Book compared to the other 3...We get POV from Both Four & Tris. Every other chapter switches between their pov and it really allows you to get into the head of Four(more on this later).2. CharactersThis book switches between Four & Tris and it does so very well but a lot of time it almost feels like they are the same person. Tris even admits her relationship with FOur is more serious as they don't really have a sense of humor.I've honestly never really cared for their relationship....Tris doesn't have much chemistry with Four and up until Book 3 Four has always seemed one-dimensional to me. I enjoyed getting to know about Four in this book but to be honest...his Parental issues were getting on my nerves. Had this been Book 1 or 2, I wouldn't have minded but this is Book 3 and Four spends most of this book just whining and whining and it's like dude...it's time to get over it.Four also does something completely stupid and ignorant that has horrible consequences and I thought Okay...FINALLY, Four/Tris will become interesting but that only lasts for a couple of chapters and then it is back to \"Woe is Me\" Four.Tris was equally boring. She spends the first half of the book sort of doing nothing really but investigating and reading but nothing memorable. The last half of the book, she starts to come alive but for her to be a protagonist and the lead character she was boring. Four, despite all his whining, was far more interesting because at least he had major development.One thing I hate about Tris is that I miss the Tris we sort of saw in Abnegation in Book 1. It's like as soon as she got to Dauntless she became this hard-ass and lost her Abnegation side most of the time. I didn't care about Tris at all in this book.Secondary characters....Eh, they were not that interesting.Peter is here in this book but what was the Point of Peter except a choice he makes at the end? If Peter is going to make a big decision like he did in the end, then give the boy more screentime. He'd be in a scene but he just wouldn't talk. He was literally just there for the book.Christina was likeable and did very well in her supporting role...especially at the end of the book. I enjoyed Christina and I wish she had a little more to do than her sarcasm and being the good friend role.]Caleb had some great development and I did enjoy Tris in her scenes with him. I actually like the character of Caleb because he shows the desperation and flaws of Human nature all in one character.I Also love cara and her quips and sarcasm. She certainly brought humor to the story in her scenes and I am so glad we got Cara in this book.There are a bunch of other secondary characters who are more or less one-dimensional and are merely there to further the plot along.3. OverallThis was not a satisfying end to the trilogy.  It was too slow in some parts and the ending not only felt rushed it feels like it sorts of cheats fans of the trilogy.I am no fan but if you are going to go for that ending, give it more of an UMPH and don't make it feel like it is tacked on.I also got a major Hunger games rip-off this book...Especially with Mockingjay. Like there is an event in the book that makes me think of mockingjay and i was like really, that's the best you can come up with?While we discovered the root of the factions, it just feels a bit meh. When the characters discover the truth about the factions and the outside world and what may be out there, i wanted more from them but instead we got more talking and more talking.The biggest thing that annoyed me was Tris/Four in this book. Their relationship troubles are always so petty. They fight over the dumbest of things only to make up a chapter or two later. But they have a legit reason to have an issue and Tris is one of those girls I hate. They credit the fact that they are a strong person to the fact that their man made them feel that way.Really? So had she never met four would Tris always be some shy and quiet abnegation girl? I mean she picked Dauntless before she had even met Four so i would think she'd still be strong and brave even without Four.Ugh.I am so glad this series is over....Definitely a 1.5 out of 5 Stars read.", "reviewerName": "Micah Dawson \"micahdawson\"", "summary": "A Slap in the Face.....Boring & Lifeless", "helpful": [8, 10], "overall": 1.0, "unixReviewTime": 1382572800, "reviewerID": "AZ9BNZE5A8TA3"}

{"reviewTime": "05 2, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Sadly, the final installment of the Divergent series falls dramatically short. Most frustrating was the change to multiple 1st person perspectives; Tris continues to narrate, but Tobias alternates as well. While this may have been necessary for plot convenience, the  &#34;divergence&#34; was from the earlier volumes was awkward and required occasionally flipping back to each chapter start to be reminded of who was narrating. As irritating and inconvenience this back and forth was, the story itself is woefully inadequate.For readers of the first two volumes, it was rather obvious from the outset, that the factional society was artificially constructed and imposed on the inhabitants. For example, there didn't seem to be any logical explanation, nor was one offered as to how a population would ever arrive at the conclusion and voluntarily agree to hand over political power to the only group that claims not to want power at all. Beyond the city, where most of the action takes place, we learn of a vague history of what sounds like attempts at genetic engineering with disastrous results that led to a civil war that the country is still recovering from. Somehow, this city (and others) were created as experiments to reset humanity. The science fiction elements are exceptionally poorly rendered and are either vague, ludicrous or incomprehensible. It's unclear exactly what their goal is as Tris' divergent status appears desirable, but she is treated simply as an ongoing data point, rather than an expected result.With at least multiple generations beyond our current timeframe, the future is rather indistinguishable from today. People fly in airplanes, drive cars, shoot guns, and stare at computer screens.Medical science has only advanced in the development of various &#34;serums&#34; which ironically sounds more like a throwback to turn of the 20th century medicine. The death serum in particular sounds a lot like just a chemical weapon that doesn't need much sophisticated science to create. In essence, the global chemical weapons ban and the Helsinki Accord on human experimentation have been discarded.

{"reviewTime": "02 3, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I love this trilogy. I think it had a lot of very deep and important things to say about human nature, about the sociology of how people interact in groups, about courage and identity and different kinds of relationships, and all the vagarities of sin and forgiveness. As for criticisms, the writing was a bit plain for my taste, though I won&#8217;t mark it down too much for that, and a lot of the love scenes felt not quite as emotional as they could have- I didn&#8217;t feel like I was really INSIDE the character&#8217;s heads as much. Also, the POV&#8217;s of Tris and Four didn&#8217;t have super distinct voices to them, which was disappointing. But there was so much else that I loved about these books that I can definitely forgive the little things.I especially like how Roth portrayed love over the three books: how in the beginning Tris saw Four as this sort of mythical creature, perfectly strong and sexy. Over time, she began to see his weaknesses, the places where his personality steered him wrong. I loved the passage about how they choose each other over and over again, about how love wasn&#8217;t just something you fall into and it&#8217;s done for good. This is a very mature view of love and I was happy to see it in a YA. I also like the notion that they change together that they stay together because they make each other better and that respect is a huge part of that, in action not just in name only.I also liked the development of Tris&#8217; notions about selflessness throughout the book: how at the beginning it was something that was forced upon her, and it wasn&#8217;t something she valued until she was able to choose it freely for herself and to reframe it as an act of courage. I love that her sacrifice at the end was a true sacrifice. By then, I really felt that she didn&#8217;t want to die and that it meant a hell of a lot to her that she survive, but she felt she had to do something.The worldbuilding was very ambitious in this book and I appreciate all the hard work that went into this. Personally, though, I could have used a few less &#8220;new plans&#8221; and changes in dimensional reality. It seemed like a lot of time was taken up in making new plans and plan preparation and it was time I would have rather spent sunken into the characters. I do appreciate how each plan was a new formulation of morality based on the available knowledge, and how difficult and terrible it is to make choices with huge consequences when you have both imperfect choices and imperfect information. Also, because this was all done quickly, I felt like the details of the plans were not as fully formed as they could have been, and quite a few things were glossed over. The characters&#8217; continual free rein to move about the compound at the Bureau strained credulity a bit, as did the fact that there weren&#8217;t surveillance devices to catch them scheming, especially after one of their number was convicted (and conveniently released) for doing just that. In a world that thrived on surveillance devices, it was weird how many places there were in this last book that didn&#8217;t have them.And now, I have to comment on the ending. First, I think it was brilliant that in a trilogy about courage, she ended it with our two main characters showing 2 very different types of courage: the courage to give your life when you don&#8217;t want to, and the courage to go on living when you don&#8217;t want to.I don&#8217;t know that anyone who is not a writer could possibly understand what it is like to kill a character, especially one whose head you&#8217;ve lived in for three books, thousands and thousands of hours. It&#8217;s like killing your own child whose life and world you created. It&#8217;s like killing yourself. You don&#8217;t do it because you are cruel or because you think it&#8217;s &#8220;grabby.&#8221; You do it because it must be done. Because that is the truth of the story. Because in a story about war, not everyone wins.Roth&#8217;s writing is very deliberate. She uses symbolism fervently, frequently, so that every scene echoes with her message, and it&#8217;s an important one. All of her scenes are very purposeful, even the quiet ones, and I don&#8217;t know how anyone could write so brilliantly about war and not lived in the middle of one. Maybe she has, I don&#8217;t know. But her conclusions about human nature are morbidly hard to look away from, almost as hard as they are to live with. Because I suspect they are all true.We are the best and the worst there is. We draw lines between people and we fight and condemn and hate, but we always draw together at the same time. Neither impulse can be denied and neither impulse is completely healthy.I think it is a sign of how important this book is that all the top reviews for it on goodreads are these flashy, surface-level negative rants about the reader&#8217;s disagreement with the writer&#8217;s choices, because it was NOT a feel-good book. These reviews were crammed with capital letters and condemnations and moving pictures and they are just like what popular culture has been accused of being: a distraction from what&#8217;s truly important.Roth dared to write a vital, wise, deep book in a popular genre that can be pretty shallow in its readership and a lot of people are slamming her for it. It makes me sick to see her punished for being daring enough to say something true that we didn&#8217;t want to hear. So, Ms. Roth, if you ever read this little review, know that I applaud you.

{"reviewTime": "10 26, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "First off, I just want to say that I absolutely loved Divergent and Insurgent. Even though I didn't like Divergent for the first few chapters, I started to like it more and more as I read on and ended up loving it. I've been waiting for the past few months for Allegiant to come out since I finished the first two in July and with the huge cliffhanger in Insurgent, I was hoping that Allegiant was going to be even bigger.I was a little wrong. I thought that it was very slow, kind of boring at times, which I wish I didn't have to admit to that. it was really hard to distinguish whose POV I was reading. I had to keep going back to the beginning of the chapter to see which one it was. As much as I love Tris and Tobias, their actions were somewhat the same at times. For some reason, Cara was always touching her hair. Most of the storyline just seemed unrealistic and hard to believe. It was much more convincing in Divergent and Insurgent, which is why I do feel like this book was kind of a let down.The ending. -----SPOILERS!!!-----I think most people, knowing how Tris truly is, probably expected her to sacrifice herself for her brother, Caleb. She may not have realized it until the very last minute since Caleb was supposed to be the one to go in the Weapons Lab, but she comes from Abnegation where you are to be selfless. She always thought that she was selfish, but as it turns out she never really was. Even Tobias saw it the minute she dropped to the net in Dauntless HQ.What gets me (and that someone else had mentioned in another review) is that Tris lived through the death serum, when no one can survive through it because it seeps into your skin and kills you, but Tris who is Divergent, lived through it, only to have David waiting for her. You'd think as obsessed as he was about GP's and GD's that he'd want to experiment on her to figure out how she survived the death serum, but then we know what he does next.I've read a lot of reviews about how everyone is pretty upset about the ending and I am in a way not too happy ether. - how Tris dies, how sad and depressed Tobias is and oh yes, it is truly depressing. I've cried and cried and can't seem to stop. The main character that we've grown to love has died, has left behind the one person who she loved and he claimed to be her new family in Insurgent after her parents sacrificed themselves for their only daughter, while Caleb betrayed all of them. I could not stop crying the last 30 pages of the book. It is truly heart wrenching. After waiting so long for this book you only want Tris and Tobias to finally have a nice happy ending to live their lives how they've always wanted to, which is very upsetting to find out that it doesn't end that way.I've read people complain that it leaves you with no hope, but I think in a way it does and I'll explain that in just a minute. I feel like I can somewhat relate to Tobias' grief in problems in my own life. After Tris dies, he wants so badly to just take the memory reset serum and to forget everything that has happened, which I and I'm sure other people would like to forget things in our past as well, but Christina convinces him not to because it would be just like Tris never happened. The good out weighs the bad even if the bad is so hard to get through day after day. We know that Tobias is brave, but as he says on page 509 - &#34;There are so many ways to be brave in this world....&#34; --  &#34;Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life. That is the sort of bravery I must have now.&#34;Two and a half years later shows the hope in Tobias. His life has continued even though he's without the one he loved the most. He's reconciled with his mother and hope it all goes well. He has a job and is gun-free to try to live a better and safe life. He faces his fears by going on the zip line (something that Tris loved to do but Tobias was afraid of heights) and does it all for Tris, the one he will always love and never forget, in memory of her by spreading her ashes. He has his friends and Tris' friends by his side and to always have the memories together. &#34;Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one. We can't escape that damage. But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other.&#34; This is the hope.Lastly, I just want to say that this has been one of the hardest reviews I've ever written on anything. I can't stop crying. I'm giving it a 4 star rating even though the story wasn't as good as the first two books and has a terrible tragic ending that will be very hard to forget anytime soon, I would recommend it, especially if you've read Divergent and Insurgent.

{"reviewTime": "11 8, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I devoured the first two novels in this series.  I liked Divergent, found it to be a quick, light read that also contained an interesting and creative premise, and so of course I purchased the second novel.  Insurgent wasn't as good, but I was willing to wait for the third installment to see how Ms. Roth wrapped things up.There were many things left unanswered in the first two books so when I picked up Allegiant I was expecting to have those answers I was hoping for.  They were given to me.  And I was not happy.It seemed as though the author wasn't quite sure of her own story with the first two books, and I had my suspicions that this was the case but I was willing to give her a chance because this story had SO much potential to make a statement in a creative and artistic manner.  I was greeted with pages of characters whining and repeating the same sentiments over and over, a lack of distinction between the voices of Tris and Tobias, unbelievable explanations for what is beyond the world of factions and Divergent individuals and much, much more.First of all, for there to be no real reason for Divergent people is ridiculous.  The first two books placed so much emphasis on these different individuals, building them up to be special just to blow that plot line off entirely was a complete letdown.  I think, had the author perhaps had more time she could have come up with a better reason for there being Divergent individuals in the first place, but she had no idea in mind in Book One, no idea in Book Two, and certainly no idea in Book Three.  It was frustrating.Also, there's the alternating perspectives.  Many have addressed this so I'm just going to say that the two characters were absolutely indistinguishable from one another.  One thing I CAN say is that while Tobias did spend a lot of time whining about being 'damaged', I thought his character development worked fairly well.  Tobias spent his whole life thinking that we was special, that he was a leader.  When he finds out that not only is he not special he is literally considered, by the government, to be 'damaged', I think his reactions though redundant, were accurate.  I wish he could have developed beyond that, maybe finding a middle ground between badass and wimp, but that didn't happen.The explanations given for all the things we were curious about were just lame.  The plot felt contrived and the story felt rushed.  I didn't read this one as quickly as I did the other two, and I didn't even feel like I was in the same series, to be honest.I read somewhere that the author stated that she had no idea when she started the series where she was going with it, and I think that this fact unfortunately caught up with her in 'Allegiant\".The author is young and shows a lot of potential for development in her writing so I will be reading more from her in the future because I always give authors a second (or in this case, really, fourth) chance.The ending...I knew what would happen when I was introduced to the dual POV, so it didn't come as a surprise to me and I wasn't sad.  I was angry that the author didn't end the series in a more realistic way.  Tris, being truly selfless, would never have left Tobias to grieve her loss after all that he's been through.  Tris wouldn't have been so selfish as to essentially go on a suicide mission.  I think the Tris we've grown to know would have realized that death is the selfish option, not the least selfish.  She didn't have to die, and I am not saying that because I am upset about her death.  I saw it coming a mile away and while suffering through the narrative I wished for her to die many times.  No, I am saying this because she really did not have to die.  We, the readers, already knew that Tris was willing to be a martyr.  She tried to do so before and was unable to.  We were aware of her savior complex.  She could have shown her complete selflessness in a hundred other ways that I can think of rather than dying for her brother who, by the way, could have been given his redemption.  Ultimately I think the more selfless thing she could have done was to have allowed Caleb his redemption.As I've said I will read more from this author, but right now I think she's just too naive to pull something like this off properly.  I love the potential she shows and she's a wonderful story teller.  I think when she was self-published she did a much better job of telling a story.  I wish she would have just stuck with that, to be honest.  I think she's an intelligent young woman with a lot of talent and I do hope that we all get to explore her true potential someday.

{"reviewTime": "11 18, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "*Spoilers* First of all let me just say that I cheated. I read a bunch of reviews on Amazon a couple of days after the book came out and so I was emotionally prepared for the ending.Perhaps because of this mental and emotional preparation, I was okay with Tris&#8217;s death. While it might not have been what I wanted to happen, it made sense for her character and for the plot line. And having Tris prove immune to the death serum, but then die immediately after from bullet wounds was a great twist. I can be at peace with how things played out and how Tobias (Four) and Evelyn eventually reconcile. I love how many of the characters remain friends and start their lives over together after the experiment is disbanded. The only disappointment in terms of character development was Peter. The way that Roth had the inner conflict of Peter play out was interesting and unpredictable &#8211; it showed that even the most evil of people could perhaps find redemption. But I was not a fan of Peter once he took the memory serum &#8211; he was at first a dumb baby, and then sort of disappeared from the story with the shallow explanation that some of his harsher traits had resurfaced. I felt this was a poor wrap-up to an integral and interesting character.I gave the book three stars mainly because of the Tris and Tobias POV switching. Had this been done well, it would have made the book. But it was not done well. Not at all. In fact I kept finding myself in the middle of chapters and not being able to figure out if Tris or Tobias was narrating. The fact is, Roth could not seem to write from a male point of view. Tobias sounded like a girl. And he sounded just like Tris. It was beyond disappointing for such a strong character in the first two books.My final thought is that while I&#8217;m fine with Tris&#8217;s death, and her sacrifice to save Caleb&#8217;s life, I would have wished for Tris and Tobias to have a more united front in this last book. It would have been far more satisfying if they bickered less, lied less, and tried to spend as much time together as possible. Then we readers could feel like they&#8217;d had their time and Tris&#8217;s death was a tragic, but beautiful end.Instead Tris and Tobias seemed to disconnect from one another at every chance possible. They still couldn&#8217;t seem to trust each other. They spent little time actually in one another&#8217;s presence and when they did, they were either fighting or making out. This made her death feel more wasteful and much less tragic.Overall, while I did not love the end to this trilogy, I didn&#8217;t hate it either. I&#8217;m satisfied with how Roth has wrapped things up, even if the society she portrayed has been written before and written much better (&#8220;Pines&#8221; by Blake Crouch). &#8220;Divergent&#8221; alone is the reason to read this series &#8211; the chemistry between Tris and Tobias hooks you instantly and carries you through till the end of &#8220;Allegiant.&#8221;", "reviewerName": "M Kircher", "summary": "At Peace With The Ending", "helpful": [3, 5], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1384732800, "reviewerID": "A1GV4CZRUKR766"}

{"reviewTime": "10 28, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "If you weren't madly in love with Divergent or Insurgent, Allegiant probably isn't going to change your mind. If you loved the first two books, one of two things is likely to happen: you're going to feel like this is the perfect, inevitable ending to the trilogy, or you're going to hate it. I'll have a spoiler section in a bit to talk about the ending, but as for the major content of the book, this is what you'll get:1. More of an emphasis on ideas than action for the first 2/3. This doesn't mean nothing happens, but the tension comes from a different place than it does for most of first two books. This will bore some people quite a lot, but if you're like me, and you find questions about what motivates human behavior interesting, and you love to critically analyze where assumptions come from and how they become problematic, you might find this section fascinating, as I did. I love peeking over Roth's shoulder as she examines where humanity's aggression comes from and how we fool ourselves into thinking these answers are obvious.The fact that a YA book bothered to dig deeper into these complex situations without offering easy, parental answers is impressive--much of the recent YA I've come across struggles to deal with anything more than love triangles and supernatural powers. This careful consideration of what constitutes moral behavior digs deeper than the first two books. I liked the first two, but they were a little immature in the complexity of thought compared to this one. I see this as a pro, but as I said, if you don't enjoy this sort of reading, you might get bored.2. Struggles between Tris and Four. I love love love Tris and Four's relationship, and I have since the beginning. I loathe insta-love in books. It's stupid and immature and completely unrealistic, and I'm not a fan of love triangles either. Tris and Four have been better developed than that, and considering the state of things after Insurgent, it wouldn't be consistent or realistic if they didn't have some bumps here. I thought they were explored well for the most part, and Four's issues in this book were occasionally frustrating, but I always felt like his behavior was real and consistent with his character, despite the fact that he sometimes did things I didn't agree with.3. The resolution of the battle for the city and the exploration of the world beyond. This part is intriguing, although in a couple places it meanders a bit. New characters are introduced that, frankly, aren't nearly as interesting as the old ones, but they don't spend a lot of time in the forefront of the plot, so it isn't a big detraction. This part delves into the original development of the city and the factions and you'll learn about the vast conspiracy that set all of that up--and how it influences things for the better and worse now.Finally, the ending. SPOILERS follow, but mostly about theme and tone. I won't discuss specific plot points, but you'll probably be able to infer some content if you keep going.This series takes place in a dark world, and it's only getting darker. Characters are killed (think of how many died in Divergent alone), Tris and Four endure terrible grief and hardship, and the violence in these books is unflinching.That being said, I was kind of expecting this ending. It's true, the ending is not what I would call a happy one, but I do think it's the right one. Roth could have arranged things so that everything worked out perfectly and everyone lived happily ever after, but to be honest, that's the ending that would have made me angry. It doesn't fit the world or the characters, for one thing. There are so many dystopian YA books on the market that end just like that. They play it safe, and as a result, they're predictable and boring. I've read so many of them that they blend together at this point, and it takes a lot for a book, and a character, to have lasting resonance.Tragedy abounds in literature for a reason. Complicated endings keep a story in a reader's mind for a long time as we try to figure out why we had such a strong reaction to the events in the book. It forces us to be engaged, to respond, and to think. The ending to Allegiant is beautiful, meaningful, and perhaps most important, consistent with the themes, characters and world that this series is set in. It isn't an easy ending or a fun one, but it's real, and far more adult than most YA I've read. I won't be forgetting Tris or the journey I've been on or the way this has made me think anew about what it means to be strong. If the ending were different, some of that power would have been lost, and Tris and Four and this story deserve to be remembered.", "reviewerName": "mm", "summary": "More Adult than YA", "helpful": [2, 14], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1382918400, "reviewerID": "A3TUU89VLARB63"}

I did think that the switching points of view was confusing at first but it was fine after awhile and I wish the entire series had been written as such.

This is different and better in terms of interpreting how the heroine would behave at the end of the series.  Tris was a whole person, a different person until the end.  Katniss of the Hunger games was a quitter in the end.

{"reviewTime": "10 28, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I really loved Divergent and Insurgent kept the series going for me. This book started out okay but once they got on the outside it just lost the tone of the series for me. It seems like it focused too much on Tris and Tobias fighting and making up and then rushed through the action, the parts that actual added to the story. Aside from the annoying back and forth between Know-it-all Tris and Stubborn-little-boy Tobias, you had the conflict of the situation in Chicago and then the new GP vs GD conflict. Neither of which really had a satisfying resolution.  I mean Tris died to do the memory wipe but David as still in charge after that and what everyone was just magically living together in perfect GP/GD harmony? I was disappointed that Tris died but I was more disappointed that she didn't die for a good enough reason. If Amar could get Tobias and Christina could get into the city so easily and inoculate certain people against the memory serum why didn't they just do that. And it seems like Nita and Matthew could have figured out long ago to use the memory serum on everyone. Nita had planned to use the death serum, Matthew was against that why wouldn't he have suggested the memory serum as a compromise. And if David was so suspicious of Tris hanging out with GD people why would he make her part of his council? She came into the compound with her GD brother, best friend and boyfriend, she lived in the dorm with the same GD people the entire time and in the end her give away was she was spending too much time with GD people?  And then Tobias is able to end the entire conflict with the factionless by appealing to Evelyn's motherly side. A mother who abandoned him, used him, spent most of her life planning this rebellion and just went okay I will give up? And all the factionless who had been spit on their whole lives just went okay cool you have your son back let just forgive and forget. And the same thing with Marcus he starts to disagree with the compromise Evelyn sets up and the Joanna is just like no and he backs down. She threatens that she will expose him for refusing peaceful terms but why should that matter? I mean why didn't everyone reject him when they found out about his abuse and Tobias.  It doesn't even make sense that Joanna would have accepted him as a leader for the Allegiant in the first place. It felt like it was all forced for the end when Tobias has to \"choose between his parents.\" And then Marcus just disappears. And I didn't really feel clear on the whole experiment. So when there was a large population of Divergent they were supposed to come out and do what exactly? If they are trying to keep them in a controlled area until future generations are genetically repaired why leave so many GD on the outside, just to discriminate against them. The GP supposedly hated them and punished them to harshly while the GP got away with stuff. But when Tobias tried to help the rebels get ahold of the death serum they didn't really do anything to him. I didn't care for both perspectives. After the first two books it really messed with the flow of the series. Now I see the whole point was so Tris could be killed but it didn't feel like a natural progression of the series and aside from mentioning each others names it was easy to forget which person you were reading. Tobias's perspective didn't add to the story it distracted from it.  It felt like you were getting half a story from him and half a story from her, but since they were both doing such different things all the time you were never getting the full story. This whole book felt incomplete and forced. The resolutions weren't satisfying nor did they make sense for the series as a whole. The book was called Allegiant and so was the group that wanted factions back but the book didn't really have anything to with that. I would have called it Tangent because she started out telling the Divergent story but then got caught up in this other thing with genetic testing, and it got convoluted like she lost a clear vision for the story.  The characters felt like pawns, like Roth had forgotten the passion with which she built these strong characters in the first two books. She was just having them do whatever she wanted whether it was fitting to their character or not. If you are going to kill such a strong character like Tris then the death should feel impactful and meaningful, hers did not. Peter could have died long ago, he didn't need to be in this book. Who cares if he gets to start over and try to be a good person?

I don't expect much YA novels to be Hemingway, or Rowling even, but reading Roth's monotonous and continuously stilted, short sentences for the duration of this story made me long for some artistic flare.  A bit of purple prose, even.My main problem is that Roth, for having decided to alternate POVs to both Tris and Tobias, has created no discernible tonal differences between the two.  Neither develop a distinct personality and that leads to a boring read.  If each chapter title did not state whether it was in Tris or Tobias' view, then I would not have been able to tell who was the narrator, aside from situationally figuring it out.  Both viewpoints really do read that similarly.Again, the very minimal diction (not to be confused with the bare style of The Road, an artistic masterpiece in simplicity) also leads to little passion.  For all the kissing that Tobias and Tris do (a lot), there's little romance and tension.  Unfortunately, this style also renders the rest of the novel, including all those action scenes, as repetitive and somewhat boring.Finally, about that ending.  I give a lot of leeway to authors.  They can do whatever they want, even if it devastates me, as long as it serves a purpose.  In this case, I don't see how the ending served the story for the better except for \"shock-value,\" mainly because the end is filled with too many plot holes.

I think this book rounded everything out nicely and pulled together all of the probable loose ends. Did I like the ending, no. I kept waiting for the story to say, 'just kidding, that didn't happen'. But, in the end, it did and I was sad for a few minutes after finishing the story. I almost cried a little.I thought of this book as a combination of The Hunger Games and the movie The Village. Actually, with that comparison, on some levels, I liked these books better than The Hunger Games because they're more believable and realistic to where we are in our world with genetics. When people talk about genetics they always seem to think of designer babies and parents choosing superfluous things like hair and eye color, but, as in this book, it could be more than that. They've chosen to 'breed out bad genes' to try to eliminate murder, selfishness, fear, and other things. Could we actually go that far, probably not. However, I believe I've heard of talk of a 'murder gene' or 'violence gene' or something like that. This book definitely got me thinking, which I think a good book will do.This book was written from two different perspectives, Tris and Tobias, and the perspective changed almost every chapter (it was weird and confusing that some chapters ended but then still had the same voice/perspective in the next chapter). I've read this style of writing before and enjoyed it. However, in this book, it didn't work out as well and I found myself flipping back to the beginning of the chapter from time to time to figure out who was speaking. This is disappointing since one is a male and one is female character and you would think they'd think/act differently. They didn't have drastically different perspectives, which is kind of the point of this writing style, and it seems it was only done due to the ending of the book. It seems as if the author could have kept with her same first person perspective of Tris throughout and simply deviated near the end when it became necessary.Divergent was by far the best book in this series, as trilogies generally go. However, Allegiant was the worst of them. Yes, it had its plot twists throughout, but so much of the story was explaining the Bureau, introducing new characters, and talking about 'the war' that never really happened. Yes, I think it wrapped up the end of the series as best as it could, but it didn't have that satisfying 'bang' at the end like a good series should.

I was thrown off and disappointed right away when I noticed that every other chapter (give or take a few) alternated between Tris' point of view and Tobias point of view.  This wouldn't be a big deal, or even a problem except that the writing and voice was exactly the same for both characters.  I found this disappointing b/c I feel like if you're going to take that risk in the 3rd book of series, you better really be able to capture each of your character's unique voices, and in this book, Roth failed at that.  The only way I could tell the difference between who was talking was b/c at the beginning of each chapter, it actually tells you at the top (As an author, if you really think that needs to be done, that should give you a clue that the writing is not strong enough to continue in that way).  SPOILER ALERT-The reason she does this is b/c Tris dies, but not where the story should end, so Tobias has to take us through the rest of the story.  I understand the story reason for this and think it's a very bold move to kill your protagonist, but think the voice could've been stronger so I felt like I was really hearing Tobias, not just another teenager who sounds like Tris.As the story goes on, it lags a lot-there are about 50-60 pages in the middle that don't add anything to story or really need to be there and seem redundant and tedious.  Once the action really gets going, it is good and I like where the plot goes, but it just takes SO long to get there!!I really wanted to like this book, but the end just sorta drops off, like she didn't really know where to go with it.Overall, the first 2 books are FAR better than this one.

However, I do have a little to say.....***SPOILERS AHEAD***Basically, Roth betrayed us all by not writing in the same caliber she had for the first two books. She wrote both Tris' and Tobias' points of view in the same, nondescript voice, which was a voice that was quite different from both of their personalities we had come to know and love in Divergent & Insurgent. Throughout most of the book, I had to turn back several pages to figure out whose point of view I was muddling through at the time.In addition to this problem, Roth also rendered all of the progress our favorite characters had made thus far completely irrelevant. Oh, you think you're special? Nah, that's not true...you're either exactly the way we've programmed you to be, or you're defective.If that's not bad enough, Roth also kills off a main character without any purpose. Well, that's not strictly true...I suspect she killed Tris so that she (Roth) could be different. She wanted to be the author that &#34;went there.&#34; Well, congratulations, Veronica, you did &#34;go there.&#34; However, &#34;there&#34; is not a place you should be happy to have gone. If you were going to have Tris die, that's perfectly fine, but you need to give it the full attention and respect such a situation deserves. She should have died from the death serum, just after she released Abnegation's serum, or in some other heroic way that actually accomplished something. I just found it stupid that she made it through the death serum, accomplished her goal, and then got shot. Also, it was incredibly cruel how Tobias, thinking his love was alive and well when she was not, made a comment about moving on and starting his life with Tris. And everything after her death was even more pointless. Tobias stayed in touch with his idiotic mother, was unable to move past his fear of heights and even struggled to honor Tris' memory by doing the zipline, and still hadn't shown much progress in moving on after 2 years of her being gone.Well, I suppose I did get a little long-winded there, but trust me when I tell you that I had MUCH more to say that I chose to hold in.

You can see how she has changed from Insurgent. The plot itself was clever and I liked the inclusion of 'real life' in it, and the way it served to the reader, as a reminder that the Divergent universe isn't real, it doesn't exist and we are all as small in the world as Tris was to the Bureau. On the other hand, I felt as if Roth tried too hard to make Allegiant 'bigger' than it needed to be; there was meaning already in the series and this direction felt to me too much like a contrived attempt at creating depth in an already deep storyline.The self sacrifice element annoyed me. That's happened, she did that in Insurgent. I would have liked for her to realise that sometimes you need to take a step back and that her life is important too. It was a disappointing plot inclusion.That's not to say that character death itself doesn't work, take the film Children of Men for example (there are lots more but I can't think of them right now).In Allegiant, I found it to be contrived, disappointing and unsatisfactory. When I read who died I hoped that despite this, the plot would come together and there would still be that feeling you get when you finish the last page of a series, like you've been holding your breath, but it didn't. I just felt sad for everyone in the book. This sort of decisions can work and obviously not everything has to have a happy ending but here it would have been appropriate. The idea was solid but the execution lacked the poise and cohesion that was Divergent.I think Veronica Roth tried to make Allegiant bigger than what it should have been. Divergent worked so well because it was contained, it was clean. But Allegiant delved too deeply into issues that would have been better left untouched.

I had a hard time getting through it, it didn't grab my attention and force me to read as the other books in this series did. The science experiments seemed dull and stilted.

I think the author was trying to get at a chilling, Hitler esque idea around race and purity, but it was ineffective. I work in the field of science and was disappointed in how ridiculously science was portrayed in this novel. But worst of all, how boring it was.The shifting perspectives was a neat idea, but poorly executed. Tris and Four's voices were so similar as to be interchangeable. I like the idea of the author exploring how Four's abuse shaped him, but it ended up feeling very shallow, somehow lacking a believable voice, depth, or something.The main reason I am giving this three stars rather than two, is that I do appreciate that the author took a risk in the end and ended it in a way that she must have known would be unpopular. I've read many YA series, and this is the first one I can think of where the author dared to *SPOILER ALERT* kill off the main character. I like that.

I, like the world and his wife had waited (very impatiently) for the final installment of Tris and Four's story. Then I read the reviews, i heard the shocking spoiler, I couldn't run, I couldn't hide. I couldn't make sense of why an author would callously kill off her own beloved protagonist.`Just like that' I heard. It couldn't be true!! Why, why, why why? So I thought if I didn't read it, it would never happen. Tris and Four would be happy farming their dystopian wasteland with at least 10 dysfunctioning babies.Then I finally put on my big girl panties and decided it was time, time to face my fears without the aid of any serum and just bloody read it. Then I could also go on a Veronica bashing spree and be done with it. I could move on and forget an author had butchered and killed my hopes and dreams.What I wasn't prepared for was what I actually read. Tris, Christina and Cara are spared death for revealing the Edith Prior footage. Tobias (Four) knows he cannot stay with his mother Everlyn, she has gone nuts. Power hungry and ruling worse than it ever was in the factions. Jeanine Matthews is dead.Caleb has been sentenced to death (and rightly so, is what I thought) One chance abduction and Tris is brought into the world of the Allegiant. Led by Tori and Johanna they plan to find a better way, one outside the city and one trying to overcome Everlyn's new regime.So the story is set. Trish will travel outside the city with Tobias, Christina, Cara, Uriah, Tori and Caleb the rest will stay and fight. What they find is more horrific than what is inside. They are plunged in a world of double-dealing, lies, back stabbing and more lies.The compound isn't all it seems and neither is the fringe. The enemy isn't who they believe it to be, and their allies aren't either. The story is slow to start with, building piece by piece but that is part of it brilliance. It is EXPLAINED, maybe a slow poke like me needs the slow blow-by-blow account of how the world got the way it was but I was fascinated by the perceptions of the GP's (Genetically Pure) to GD's (Genetically Damaged) to the people in the Fringe (I was expecting Mad Max to jump out on me)What I loved most was Veronica didn't spare us anything, it was an emotional roller coaster of a story, that while I knew (or I thought I did) what was coming, I knew it was the only story she could tell. Tris didn't die because the author got sick of her, or because she knew she was ending the series. This is bloody war people, good people get hurt. Good people die.If you want the happy ending pick up a Disney, better yet don't pick it up. This is a Dystopian world where it is dog eat dog. Tris died because it was the only thing that in the end would save them. I have to admit though, reading Tobias after her death had me running to the bathroom to sob my heart out. To read the 2 very short chapters of when he first noticed her ripped my soul to shreds.I'm still not over that, but it was beautifully done.

{"reviewTime": "03 20, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Allegiant. Where to begin? It's been nearly six months since this book came out and it still makes me so mad to think about it. My friends now know not to mention Divergent, Allegiant or anything that may set off one of my now infamous rants. And this will be a rant more than a review. Also, spoilers. You've been warned.The story was shoddily put together and introduced a whole new set of ideas that Tris had to navigate. Once outside the fence, we learn that apparently Chicago, and other cities, are experiments to try to breed out &#34;damaged genes&#34; from some genetic war generations ago. So the government has set up camp in O'Hare Airport to monitor the Chicago experiment and they take in those that have left.Tobias learns that he is not, in fact, Divergent at all and it sends him into a downward spiral where he becomes a whiny, useless crybaby. He joins up with some genetically damaged rebellion and helps cause an explosion that ends up killing his friend Uriah. Of course, this makes Tobias feel worse, so every time I'm in  his head, I have to listen to him whine about how much of a screw up he is.Except half the time I don't know if I'm in Tobias's head or Tris's head. Their voices were identical. I would figure it out half way through the chapter when whomever's head I was in would think about the other and then I'm like... oh... yeah. That's right I'm in Tris's head not Tobias's.And all this sets up for the &#34;bad guys&#34; to want to &#34;reset&#34; the Chicago experiment. Chicago has devolved into class warfare, essentially, and to save the experiment, they are going to use a memory wiping serum. Tris can't abide this, because, you know, their friends and families are there! Even though none of those people wanted to leave the fence. And honestly, while I DO understand why Tris and company wouldn't want this to happen, I also can see the government's side. I mean, they are practically killing each other, on the brink of all out war. Why not wipe their memories?And so, we have this conundrum. If we don't want Chicago to be memory wiped, how do we stop it? By turning the serum on the baddies, of course! Because that's ALWAYS a good idea. See how YOU like it, bad guys! Except, they can't remember anything, so they sure learned their lesson!You mean to tell me they couldn't come up with ANY better way to stop them? Really?And then there's the ending. I'll admit, it made me mad, because in YA I expect a happy ending. And Tris's death meant NOTHING. NOTHING! Not a single thing changed that wouldn't have happened had she lived.So Ms. Roth stated in a blog entry later that Tris dying was part of the plan and she finally COULD die because she learned the true meaning of self sacrifice. Well, I'll tell you what. If I gave up MY life so that my kids could live, I would be mad as hell if a few months later, my idiot daughter went and got herself killed for a stupid cause. Being selfless does not necessarily mean giving up your life. Especially if it can be avoided.I rewatched the season finale of Burn Notice recently and Madeline Westen gives up her life to buy Michael time. So he could LIVE. And when Fi tells him his plan is suicide and asks about his &#34;stupid death wish&#34; he tells her that his mother bought him a second chance and he doesn't intend to waste it. That he wants to live, probably more than he's ever wanted to. THAT is what a selfless self-sacrifice inspires. It inspires the one that lives to LIVE and do good. It doesn't inspire them to live only until they can properly sacrifice themselves.Maybe I'm reading too much into this. Maybe comparing Burn Notice to the ending of Allegiant isn't the right comparison. But Maddy's sacrifice and Michael's reaction are what I felt should have happened in Divergent/Allegiant.Besides. Tris is 16. She's WAY too young die, and for such a stupid reason/cause.So there you have it. Allegiant's story was weak, Tris's sacrifice was artificial and Tobias was a whiny crybaby that I hoped would just disappear. You win some, you lose some.

{"reviewTime": "10 30, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "4.5/5 StarsWow!! I had to wait a day or so to write this review because my head was just spinning when I put the book down (not to mention the fact that I was sobbing and needed time to catch my breath!). I think it really helped that I read all three of these books in a row because I really got to see the full arc of the story and the characters that way (without having to try to remember what it was I loved about the first two books). Plus, this way the series had momentum for me that would have been lost otherwise.The negatives:Failure to communicate.Once again, there were periods in this book where Tris and Tobias had problems based mostly on their failure to communicate. Just when I thought that they were going to really work together and face the world as a team, they would disagree over something and then pretty much not talk to each other - it made me crazy! Tris' lack of compassion also got to me sometimes (for instance, she doesn't seem to understand why Tobias might have strong feelings about his father's sentencing and then, when she does realize it's bothering him, still doesn't bother to talk to him about it). Now, to give Roth some credit, there were parts of the story where Roth did have Tris and Tobias hash out their issues (and where they made good relationship choices) - I just wish I hadn't had to suffer through their lack of communication to get to it. (Although, honestly, the relationship might not have been all that unrealistic - lack of communication is a real issue in lots of relationships!)Some people will HATE the ending.I honestly feel sorry for any author who is ending a hugely popular series like this one because it seems that there is no way to truly satisfy everyone - all these people who are waiting for their story to come to an end and might not agree with how the author does it. This is one of those cases where I can tell you right now that many people are going to hate this ending. Roth doesn't let all of our beloved characters live happily ever after in a world where all their problems have been solved - nowhere even close to that. I list this as a negative because I know many people will see this as a big negative. Most people will either love it or hate it. But I'm actually kind of on Roth's side on this one - see my note below.What I LOVED:I didn't hate the ending.Okay, that's not exactly true. In some ways I hated what happened at the end of the book. But I also felt that it made sense based on who Roth made these characters to be and the type of world they lived in. Was it painful, horrifying and gut-wrenching when certain characters we've come to know and love didn't get their happy ending? Definitely. Was it still amazing? I certainly thought so! I will not be forgetting this book any time soon - I can't stop mulling it over in my mind, and that is a sign of a fantastic story in my opinion!So many questions answered.I LOVED that this book answered all of my questions and made sense of a lot of the holes in logic from the first two books. I mean, I really didn't get why the Divergent were supposed to go out into the outside world and how they were expected to save humanity. And why was it that people in the factions had such strong tendencies toward specific behaviors? (It was explained - there was an actual reason based on genetic experimentation that was done!!) I was honestly desperately worried that the answers I would be given in Allegiant would make no sense, so I sighed a huge sigh of relief when so many things were explained in ways that made sense to me! Yay!!Tobias' struggles.I loved that we got to see half (or so) of this book from Tobias' viewpoint!! I was thrilled to see the world through his eyes and to really be able to see and sympathize with his struggles. Whereas, in the first book (and somewhat in the second), we got to see Tris' vulnerabilities and her struggles with who she was - selfless or brave - in Allegiant we got to see that Tobias, with only four fears, could still be haunted by those fears. In this book, it is Tobias who doubts who he truly is - what makes him who he is. Is it his genes, his upbringing, his choices? He struggles to come to terms with all of that and there are no easy answers. I grew to love Tobias even more in his weaknesses and was that much more behind him when he overcame them!The action.The first half of this book didn't have nearly as much action as Divergent andInsurgent, but I found myself so intrigued by learning about Tris and Tobias' world, that I actually didn't mind much. The second half of the book picked up the action quite a bit and there were enough twists and turns to keep me constantly wondering what would happen next.Allegiant gave us an explosive ending to a thrilling series! While it had a few negatives, this is not a series that I will soon forget and I'm not disappointed. I only hope that the upcoming movie does it justice!(I debated back and forth between 4 and 4.5 stars for this book, but when I compare it to other books that I rated 4 stars, I came to the conclusion that, even with its flaws, I enjoyed this book more than most.) 4.5/5 stars.", "reviewerName": "Nicole Hewitt", "summary": "A fitting farewell to an amazing series!", "helpful": [5, 11], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383091200, "reviewerID": "A39PUSVKKNSOV5"}

I anticipated finding out exactly where the author was going with the story.  Wow.  Am I ever shocked, confused, and a little disappointed.First of all, this book is COMPLETELY different from the other 2.  Not only is this book told from different points of view (Tris AND Tobias), but there is a completely different feel to this book in general.  The flow and style are different from the first 2 and it almost feels like you're reading a totally different series.I DID, however, enjoy the character development for the most part.  We see several characters growing up and maturing, while others not so much.  I was a little disappointed with Tobias' character development in this book. It just didn't feel like him. Again, it almost felt as if I was reading a totally different series.Now on to the biggest issue with the book in my opinion:  the ending.  I won't give any spoilers, but let me just say right now that I was SO INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WAY THIS BOOK ENDS!!!  So much so that I probably won't be reading the series again.  I was so frustrated w/ the turn the book took but I thought that maybe there could be a little silver lining at the end..... Nope.  Nothing.  I'm still not sure why the author decided to take this particular route.  There were so many other alternatives that didn't even come close to being as devastating as this one.Short of writing another book for this series (that would somehow undo the damage) , in my opinion, this series can't be saved.  And, unfortunately, MANY fans are saying the same thing about this book.  Even without the excruciating end, there were still issues with this book that would have been disappointing.  At first I didn't understand why other reviewers were saying that they were getting rid of the first 2 books in the series and that they would NEVER watch the movies.

I mean, I was gobsmacked and hungover by The Hunger Games trilogy, The Fault in Our Stars, Not a Drop to Drink, and This Song Will Save Your Life. They all have wildly different endings. But they all have one thing in common: SOUL DESTROYERS.I was freaking out that I would hate it. After the things I'd heard...(though, luckily, I didn't see any massive spoilers). How could I survive an end to the trilogy I'd loved so far? But I loved it. I so loved it. I had a hunch, and I was right. By 80% through, I knew what would happen. And I was right. Did that wreck the book for me? No. Ha. You're funny. I was too busy screaming.Characters? They were perfect. I mean, they were perfect in their imperfections. What I love most about this series is that the author, Veronica Roth, sets up characters who are strong: not strong as in &#34;I-will-fight-everyone-with-my-teeth&#34; (though they kind of do that as well). But they're strong in that they never act out of character. They are like REAL people. They're well written. Their thoughts make sense in their lines of thinking. Plus, I felt the characters continued to grow and mature and change. Awesome, right?Tris and Tobias? Ohhh, I love them. I loved their relationship (or lack thereof at sometimes). I love that there was no love-triangles. They knew they were for each other. Okay, yes they fought. Yes, they hated each other sometimes. But they knew they'd have to work for their relationship if they wanted to keep it. I love that there was no easy-love. Ah, just another thing to make them freakishly realistic.Plot? Like I said earlier, I did have a feeling about what would happen. I was right. It was the most epic twist in the world. I have no regrets for loving this book. But seriously? I was SO emotionally ruined. I cried. I read the book in one day. ONE DAY.The author is brave to do what she did in her book. But, you know what? The Divergent series belongs to Veronica Roth. She let us see them (thank you so much). I don't care if she had a drastic ending. I don't care if that's not what fans wanted. I care that this is HER series and she obviously did what she wanted.

So I, like other readers, had to go back and double-check sometimes to see whose POV chapter I was currently in.2) There are too many rebellions. Honestly, just too many. I don't even know why Tris takes up the Allegiant cause so easily (or at least, participates in without too much questioning) after she just got through with 2 books of fighting against factions.3) Tobias has always been portrayed as a smart guy. One decision he makes seems truly bizarre. For someone who is so thoughtful, his actions really don't make sense.I didn't think the ending was that bad. It was consistent with Tris' personality.

In the conclusion to the Divergent series, Allegiant is Veronica Roth's chance to wrap up the stories of Tris and Tobias.With the factions disbanded, the people of the city are struggling to find their rightful place. When Evelyn locks the city down, Tris, Tobias, and a number of others designated the &#34;Allegiant&#34; or rebels against the factionless, decide to escape the city in the hopes of some help from the Vast outside. What they find outside the city, however, is something none of them could have expected. They have known all along the Divergent were special, unique. They also knew the Divergent were being hunted, but they assumed those people were lost forever. When Tobias runs into the Divergent who helped him when he joined Dauntless, he can't believe he is alive. But outside the fence, there are even more secrets to be uncovered.Very quickly they learn Chicago is only one city of many experiments. All were treated differently, and not all had factions, but the most terrifying thing is the organization outside the fence is just as devious and cold as those factions inside the fence. When a war is on the brink of eruption in Chicago, they have plans to &#34;reset&#34; the experiment. Tris, Tobias and the others are stuck on the outside watching their friends and family inside being treated like mice in a maze. But if you know anything about these brave kids, you know they don't just sit idly by and watch tyrants mess with their lives. They are going to do something about it. Even if it means risking their lives.I have a truly strange relationship with this series. I loved, I mean adored the first book. The second book was good, but it just didn't have that magic for me. And again, I liked this book, but it just didn't have that spark of the first book. I will, however, say that for all of you out there who hate the romance or the relationship angles of these dystopian books (can't harm the sacred 10 people who we love so much!), you will be happy to know Roth ended this story in a way that leaves no question where her loyalties lay. She is dedicated to her story, not her characters. She is dedicated to the world, not the relationships in it. While I struggled to truly LOVE this book like I had the first, I totally respected her dedication to the world she built. I am sure it wasn't easy for her to do and she will get a lot of flak for it (much like Robert Kirkman gets for his ruthless treatment of his characters in The Walking Dead).I think the struggle with this story lies in the huge amount of conflicts all intertwined but still independent of one another that are going on. Sometimes they contradicted one another, which made the whole situation a little more confusing. For instance, there was more than one rebel movement in the fence, more than one outside the fence, people pretending to be on one side but really on a different side but actually secretly working for a third side?! Sadly, in an effort to make the story intricate and complex, it got lost in a convoluted mess. That being said, however, it wasn't a bad story.

That said, I found this spoiler online by complete accident.  At first, like many readers, I was shocked and a bit horrified.  Then I thought about how Ms. Roth took risks herself to write this ending.  She had to know that she was going to get backlash for this decision.  But it was what she first envisioned when she began writing the trilogy (never guessing how popular it would be) and she stayed true to that vision and I think that is classy.As far as the actual book, I found the storyline to be much more interesting than the second installment but not as good as \"Divergent\".  As all of the truths and lies were unraveling I got confused a few times and had to go back a few pages and reread to make sure that I understood things.  I was steeled for the ending but it still knocked the breath from me, but if it had to be written it was done masterfully. Also the rest of the book from that point on was done realistically. In every war there are going to be casualties.  There is a very famous adult author who has a series up to 14+ novels and you never have to worry about her characters being in peril because she refuses to kill them.  Its unrealistic that they could survive that much danger that many times.All that said, I agree that this will certainly cause a mess for the movies unless they change the ending drastically.

I'm not bothered by the absolutely brutal realism that Roth gives us in the ending of this book, but I am bothered by the context it's been thrown into... and the places where that realism is abandoned, where the plot loses its sense in an effort to resolve what the author has deemed not worthy of properly solving. With the dual perspectives, we are given dual endings. One half serves as shock value, and what many are referring to as \"preachy\" as Roth hammers in the themes she has stretched over the trilogy. The other half serves as an oversimplified (to the point of being illogical) solution to one of the problems brought up in the series. It almost felt like the one half was intended to be so shocking that Roth expected readers to not realize that the other bit of what was going on really made no sense at all.In Divergent, readers were given action and character development throughout the book. With Allegiant, things felt slow (though rushed towards the end) and disconnected. Readers are taken out of their comfort zone and into much more boring territory, where what lies outside the fence is revealed to be completely uninteresting. Complications in the plot, which eventually led to the entirety of the book not making much sense, were often petty problems that took up time that could have been better spent.

I had high expectations for Allegiant. I was very disappointed. First, the switch back and forth from Tris's pov to Tobias. If it had been consistent from the first book to the third it might have been okay. But, I had already decided the kind of person Tobias was based on Tris's perspective and I liked him. He was mysterious and strong, kind, yet no nonsense. The Tobias in Allegiant was nothing like the one I'd created. He was sort of a wimp. There were many times when I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to remember whose pov I was reading-there just wasn't enough personality in Tobias for me to recognize who was speaking. I understand the author must have felt the need to have the shift because of the events she chose to focus on, but I just don't think it was done well.I also feel that the author must not have much love for her characters as she kills them off so easily. By the time the book ends there's very, very, few of the beginning characters left alive. Yes, I agree war is like that, but this is also fiction, and I guess I'm the type of person who likes the heroes and heroines to survive and see the fruits of there labors(hope that's not a spoiler), especially after I've spent so long worrying there fate.I wanted to give this book only one star. I was so disappointed with the ending. I gave it two, only because there are a few points in the book that she expresses thoughts eloquently, something I really enjoyed about the first two, and I highlighted them.

So, naturally, I expected Allegiant to be all about the war and how it would change Tris and Four's life.... Did I get what I expected? Well..... No.\"Who are you? I demand. 'We are the Allegiant,' the voice replies. 'And we are many, and none.\"11% (Nook Book)I say \"no\" because there were so many things I had problems with. For instance, the characters. I'll start with Four.... When I met him in Divergent, he was a knife throwing, gun wielding, bad ass. He didn't take any shit because he had taken it most of his life already. But in Allegiant, he definitely hanged my entire attitude about him. He had none of his original qualities and I felt like he was a completely different person. I've seen a lot of bloggers say that Tobias and Tris both sound the same and that's the perfect way to put it. I felt like he was acting more like a female than the sexy bad ass I knew him to be.\"Death is so quick, so certain. Where we're going now, nothing is certain..\"17% (Nook Book)Which brings me to their romance. This was really the only thing tying me to this. I was in love with them when they were together. It was the only time that I felt like Four was back to being strong and Tris was showing her growth. And then at the end, I can't lie, my heart broke for Tobias. I wanted to jump through the book and console him. I felt EVERYTHING that he felt.\"If they told us what to believe, and we didn't come to it on our own, is it still true?\"24% (Nook Book)As for the plot, I was a little let down. In Divergent, it seemed like every chapter had a cliff hanger. And in Insurgent every PAGE had a cliff hanger. In this one, I just didn't feel like anything was hardly happening. In the beginning I was digging it, because put yourself in that situation. If you found out that your life was an experiment and your friends were dying because of other people, how would you handle that news? But then right afterwards it went to nothing. I had become so accustomed to Roth's gritty, in your face, eff your feelings attitude, that I wasn't a huge fan of the fact throwing in my face. Because that's pretty much all that Allegiant did. Which, I don't feel was 100% explained. That was a lot of information to process, and it was info dumped in my lap. I'm sure I would have had more fun with the action on the last few pages spread throughout the entire book than that madness that was the end.\"Everyone has to blame something for the way the world is.\"41% (Nook Book)And speaking of the end, I will now attempt to put my thoughts of it into words..... I understand why it happened, but the WAY it happened, I just couldn't deal. *SPOILER* Tris is bad ass and she had just survived the death serum.... And then she dies from gunshots.... -___- *END SPOILER* I felt like it should have been in a blaze of glory.

The plot was excellent, the story was incredible, and the character development was good. Every book within this series, Allegiant included, was a page turner.My reason for giving it 3 stars instead of 4 is that though Allegiant had lots of good elements, there was just SO MUCH. Here's what I mean- at points the inner monologues became incredibly verbose. Thoughts that could have easily been stated in two or three sentences were several paragraphs long. The same thing happened during conversations between characters. So, it was a little wordy at points. And secondly, I felt like I was supposed to like Tris, but I just couldn't. At the end of the book, I admired what she did, but throughout the story her character really annoyed me and because of this I had difficulty sympathizing with her. I'm not sure why she annoyed me so much...maybe it's becauseshe came across as too perfect, all of her decisions and perceptions accurate while everyone else around her fumbled in an effort to keep up with her.In the end, I kept reading because of the plot and story, not because of the characters. And it's not a good plot that makes me in fall in love with a book, it's the characters.

I did find about halfway through the novel - it got a tad slow for my liking but of course I persevered and OMG the last few chapters came and I had tears in my eyes and was like NOOOOOOOOOO - how could Veronica do that to us poor readers :) This was a tissue moment. As a reader, something I am not too keen on is the alternate POVs in chapters - one off/ one on. In Allegiant , Veronica Roth has taken a leaf out of Marie Lu's and Rachel Caine's books and written Allegiant in both Tobias aka Four and Beatrice aka Tris's POVs. In this instance though, I congratulate the author as she has done it perfectly and the story flowed beautifully.

Yes the subplots were not well developed.  The new characters were not well developed.  The state of the world was extremely ambiguous.  But you need to remember that this is Tris story.  Not the Bureau story, or the city's story, not even Tobbia's story.  This is the life of a girl that did not think much of herself and ended up saving so many people because of her selflessness.Still I do not think it deserves 5 stars.

{"reviewTime": "11 1, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Having thoroughly enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent, I was so looking forward to Allegiant. However, I did not find the novel an enjoyable read. I did not like the chapters alternating between Tobias and Tris, though I guess it was understandable considering the ending. One reason was that I could barely tell the difference in the tone between the two, and I also felt that the first two novel's flowed better because it was Tris alone narrating.  I felt that 'Under the Never Sky' did the perspective shift chapters much more successfully.And compared to the first two novels, I found Allegiant to be anti-climatic and almost completely lacking in suspense. For example, the Death Serum scene was about a single page. The scenes with serums in the first two novels were long and suspenseful. And the scene which so many readers hate so much, regarding the demise of a central character, was rushed and vague. I also felt that too much information was dumped through conversations held in the first half of the book that seemed to have little other purpose.I understand that the first novel is being turned into a movie, for which it is well suited. I cannot see how Allegiant could be turned into a movie unless it was changed significantly, for there is no substance to it. Repetitive talks about being 'genetically damaged,' spending most of the book milling about in the Bureau without achieving anything, and nothing being done with the divergents who emerged.One of the most frustrating aspects of the novel was that the previous book made it look like the divergents would save the world from endless strife, perhaps emerging as leaders of a post apocalyptic, fallen world. Yet when they did come out, nothing special was done with them at all. Not even with Tris who could resist all simulations. It cheapened the first two novels, making me wonder, what was the point of it all?One good point about the novel was stressing that 'genetically damaged' people are still just as whole as 'genetically pure,' and that we cannot justify people's bad behaviour by saying that being 'genetically damaged' was the reason.A good theme running through the book was that although people damage each other, this is not a reason to despair, for people can help to heal each other of those damages as well.The reason for the reconciliation between Caleb and Tris was one of the highlights of the novel, I felt.", "reviewerName": "Peter R.

{"reviewTime": "01 5, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I will preface this with the thought that the first tow books in Ms. Roth's Divergent series were wonderful. In addition, I know how it feels for something you create to be criticized after you work so hard at it. However, Allegiant didn't impress me in the least right up until the very end.First, I was disappointed by what was \"outside the fence.\" There was plenty of room for creativity, there were so many options for the author to explore, yet what happened was, to say the least, a let down.The lack of interesting solution to this question wasn't the only problem I had with the answer. I feel it skewed the message I took away from Divergent and Insurgent, that \"Taking a virtue, intelligence, bravery, selflessness, peacefulness, and honesty in this case, too far could cause problems. A person must keep all qualities in mind while living their life.\" Allegiant, through what was really beyond Chicago turning out to be what it was, more or less told us that those people weren't taking good things to an unhealthy extreme, they were simply genetically altered. I understand the thought process behind the whole \"revolution\" was to teach people that they weren't \"damaged,\" but that doesn't mean they weren't genetically altered, it means that they remain a person, regardless of their genes.I feel the new message, though, was a good illustration of how prejudice affects our society and why it should have no place, ever, no matter what it is about. This is one of the reasons the rating is two stars instead of one.The disappointment of the secret was only the beginning. The plot, for lack of a better word, dragged. While the first two books made me want to read them at every available moment, I forced myself to finish this book. At first with the hope that it got better, then with the thought that it would be a waste to have read over half and not finish it. I dislike not finishing books very much. The plot really picked up only at the last 100 or so pages, and there were over 500 pages in the book total. The fact the Bureau was corrupt after all of the other things going on made want to roll my eyes. The idea of \"the government controls the information so the government controls the truth\" works well in some books, but in my opinion was too much and a tad clich&eacute; in Allegiant.Switching gears, I would like to talk a bit about the point of view switching between Tobias and Tris. I understand that is is hard enough to keep one narrator's voice consistent, let alone two, but I found it very difficult to keep track of who was talking. I felt I was working too hard to figure out which person was narrating at the time by looking at the context, and I needed to keep that thought in the back of my mind while I was reading. If the author was having difficulty creating the distinct voices, she could have only used Tris' point of view and remained the same as the other two books.I feel character development was not addressed as well, and was hindered rather then helped by this new technique. All that was truly worked on was the theme of forgiveness, which we saw happen several times over. Otherwise, it was put on hold to allow more focus on the less-than-spectacular plot.Finally, we get to the ending. Contrary to many people's opinions, I was perfectly fine with the ending. It was written well enough that I teared up a bit, which I did not expect after the whole book was so unsatisfying to me. This shows the writing at the end was well done, and is the other reason for the two star rating. It couldn't compensate for the rest of the Allegiant, but I will end on the though that the very end was what I expected the whole book to be, absolutely fabulous.

{"reviewTime": "06 3, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "First off, Allegiant reveals a great maturation in Veronica Roth's writing. She illustrates relationships with more nuance and explores emotional depths only touched upon in Divergent. There are moments in Allegiant that will stay with me long after much of the rest of the trilogy will melt away in my mind. I was particularly intrigued by the passages narrated by Tobias. Full of contradictions, he is perhaps the most complex, flawed, best drawn character in the trilogy.SPOILER: Let's talk about the end. I imagine many readers will feel disappointed or even betrayed by the conclusion of the series. It seems very fashionable these days to emulate George RR Martin's practice of killing off the best characters.  I must confess the final few chapters did not culminate into the most satisfying ending I could imagine. I'm all for stories where the hero goes out like a boss at the end, but that's not quite what happens here.  Tris's death, at the hands of a very under-developed antagonist, feels almost accidental.  In such a fanciful adventure tale, where our heroes have previously escaped near certain death time and time again, the effect is dissonant to the tone of the rest of the story. It's like all of a sudden the rules got changed on us. A great ending offers surprise, but also a weight of cosmic inevitability.  Tris's death felt a little more like one of those long long joke/stories kids tell, only to pull the rug out from the listener with an abrupt ending like, \"Then suddenly they got hit by a car and died.\"  At the same time, the ending did not destroy the book (or franchise) for me either.(To those reviewers whose hearts seem devastated by the unfortunate turn of events in the last few chapters, let me suggest this: Imagine how you would have seen the story concluded, and let that be your ending. Or write Veronica Roth a letter asking her for an alternate ending. Who knows? She just might do it. Remember that Mark Twain's original ending for Huckleberry Finn had Jim captured by slavers. In a literary sense, it's a strong ending, totally consistent with the world and anti-slavery themes of the book. But readers were so disappointed that Twain later wrote an ending where Jim gets freed. But I digress).In conclusion, Veronica Roth has a voice well worth devoting some attention.

It wasn't poorly written or edited. It wasn't confusing, really. It just...fell flat. And I couldn't be more disappointed given how much I loved the first two books.I debated not writing a review but given my glowing take on the others I felt remiss leaving this one blank. As if people wouldn't figure out that, &#34;when you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all&#34; would apply.It wasn't terrible. I didn't even mind *********spoiler alert**************that she killed Tris. It was ok. Believable given that Tris should have died about 50 times prior to the moment when she finally does. But it just didn't do it for me. Instead of leaving me broken and distraught, I just felt relieved. This last book felt like one long attempt to wrap up a global story that was never really meant to be global and the lack of direction seemed kind of obvious.I'd always wondered at the tight focus (Chicaco only) of the initial world. How did these people end up in this dystopia? Was there an apocalypse? What circumstances led them to this point? (In Eden's Root I killed myself researching to cover the &#34;how&#34; and &#34;why&#34; of my apocalypse because if it didn't feel real to me, it wouldn't have felt real to anyone, Or so I thought. But maybe that's just me.)Unlike people who loved &#34;The Road,&#34; I actually want to know WHY the world is burning and dying and shaking...I don't just think, &#34;Ok, not gonna focus on that, let's focus on these two people and how they deal with it.&#34; As long as the tale is set on Earth, or any other location I know, I want to know what happened. And I said as much in my review of Divergent.But Divergent was just SO GOOD! The tight focus worked well. Roth seemed to build a whole world within that little snow globe that was rich and layered and fascinating.And then in Insurgent, the lens widened to include the other factions and explain *some* aspects of the dystopia. It was enough for me and I loved that part of the story too.And then the lens widened further and the story seemed to disappear - up in smoke - with no center and too many questions.If the U.S. took these genetic purity/cleaning steps, did the rest of the world participate? She never says. And yet, you'd assume if not that the world would have sanctioned our country for violating human rights. If the rest of the world did participate, what does the rest of it look like now? And why did Lake Michigan dry up? Did she explain that and I missed it in plodding through another 500 pages without being so riveted this time?The &#34;wider&#34; lens seemed to only cover a handful of cities and that was it. I just...didn't get it. And then there was Four.Sigh.Somehow, some way, Roth lost her sense of Four. While human vulnerability (as he showed in Divergent) made him sexier than some one-dimensional strongman hero dude, he got a little TOO soft in this book (a progression which began in Insurgent, I'll admit). It was like he dried up and blew away, just so much dandelion fluff. And no, I'm not referring to his reaction to Tris' death (which was equally lame), I mean DURING the story.He couldn't decide what he wanted, he waffled and wishy-washied, and when he and Tris finally got together &#34;all the way&#34;, there was no heat left. None. Where was the guy who had only four fears? Where was the guy who climbed the ferris wheel despite his fear? Where? It's like once he became Tobias instead of Four, he slowly deflated - a balloon with a tiny, 1000 page pinprick.And the &#34;funeral?&#34; Well, it was truly depressing, so I guess that's accurate. I actually wrote an alternate ending to comfort myself and a friend...going more for inspiration,  hope, and courage than a continual dirge.I can't recommend this read unfortunately.

Secondly, I will say that I do not need the main character to survive the series and I do not always need a happy ending. Yes, I prefer leaving a series feeling fulfilled and happy, but it's not a required formula to make a book worthwhile.I have been putting off reading this book since it came out and I didn't really know why. After Insurgent was finished I was so excited for the third book to come out, and I waited patiently. However, I waited until just a couple days ago to pick up this book. Now I wish I never did. I would gladly use some memory serum to forget all the happenings in this book.-To start off, as many others have stated, the tone of voice from Tris to Tobias really doesn't change. I found myself reading this book feeling completely disconnected from the characters I had grown to love and respect.  They both seemed like shells of their former selves, and not due to any trauma they endured.-There was no character development. If anything I was just left confused who I was even reading about anymore.-I absolutely did not like the plot of this story. It made the concept of Divergence completely pointless. I wanted there to be something unique about the divergent, I wanted them to be special. But no, it all comes down to their genes. It all comes down to something they couldn't control. Oh and what do you know, Tobias isn't even divergent at all according to his genetic code. I just didn't like all the science crap thrown in to this book. I felt like this final book was thrown together hastily and Roth just picked an idea she thought would work because she knew people wanted the third book to come out.-Not only was the plot of this book flawed, but so were the fates of some of the characters(I'll only cover Tris). I knew going into this book that there would be death, I accepted that. I knew before hand that Tris wouldn't make it. I read on anyway because I was expecting her death to mean more than it did, or at least be necessary. However, I think she was killed off just so Roth could try and be different by killing off the main character. And to avoid tying up loose ends that would have arisen had Tris survived. Tris could have let her brother die instead of her. I know there are reasons she took his place, but none of them are good enough for me. Caleb needed to prove himself and Tris took that chance away from him. I just think that if an author is going to kill the main character it should be 100% necessary and make a huge impact. I am a very emotional reader and usually get very invested in characters I love, but I didn't even feel sad when Tris died. In fact, I hardly felt sad at all throughout this book, just numb.-The book didn't make me feel emotional towards the characters. As I have stated, I am an emotional reader, but throughout this book my mood hardly changed. Allegiant didn't spark any real feelings in me besides annoyance. When I finished it I found myself feeling very empty and disappointed.-I was very excited for the movies to come out but this book has basically ruined the whole series for me. I thought the first two books were really leading to something big and exciting(whether it was good or bad) but really those two books were just leading to a massive disappointment. Now I'm not sure if I want to see the movies because I'm bitter about what the ending will be.In conclusion I would not recommend this book.

And I could argue that this was the problem: too long had past between the second and the last books, my expectations were way high, I had forgoten Roths writing style, forgoten a little of the plot. I had to re-read a lot of the first two books before starting this one, and also read the first of the Tobias Stories, to get in the mood.

But then all the in-your-face hard-ass wonderful characters that I fell in love with started, in my opinion, going completely out of character - so to speak. They explained - instead of showed with action - every single feeling they have had so far. And they explained it with therapist-like understanding of their psyque, giving a self-important life lesson at every page. Suddenly I wasn't allowed to comprehend anything for myself, everything was chewed down for me. And I swallowed it with a good dose of self-pitty that came from almost every character. I felt stupid through this whole process and that's when, around chapter 20, I almost quit reading the book.But I didn't, and I'm glad, since, shotly after, the action portion of the book began and it got a lot better. Like I said, the ending was how I thought it should have been and at least I wasn't completely frustrated with it.

The worst part is I'm sure the author agonized over how to finish her series but I kept getting the sense that she just committed to the whole gene therapy storyline out of a desire to go somewhere different and unfortunately, she stubbornly ignored the fact that it didn't work and ended up sacrificing her story and characters for it.

Just like the previous two, it is hard to put down.  And even though I may not agree with the direction that Roth took it and with all of the plot points, I can understand and appreciate why she chose to take it in that direction.  It is a fitting ending for what she began in &#34;Divergent&#34; even if all readers are not thrilled about it.  It is very hard to talk about &#34;Allegiant&#34; without giving anything away as SO many other reviewers have done (even though this isn't the forum for that), but I will try not to.The story picks up right where &#34;Insurgent&#34; left off, with the dystopian future version of Chicago in chaos because of the video that Tris made sure was shown.  In that video the residents learned that there are people outside of the fence who have placed them in that city for their own protection but that it is time to let out their divergent population.  Yet Evelyn and her factionless army do not want this to happen.  Now that they have overthrown the faction system, they want to install their own system - talk about going from bad to worse.  Yet Tris and a small band of her friends (Christina, Uriah, Cara, and Tobias, among others) sneak outside of the city to discover what is out there for themselves.  What they find is nothing like what they imagined, and it threatens to tear them apart as they try to reconcile new truths with old truths and struggle to determine if these truths are real or just more fiction.Roth made the decision to tell the story through the viewpoints of both Tris and Tobias, alternating between them.  This isn't necessarily a bad idea in theory, and for those who purchased the collection of stories from Tobias's point of view, they had some familiarity with his perspective.  The problem comes in the fact that their identities when they are telling the story are not different enough.  There were times when I had to turn back to the beginning of the chapter to remind myself who was narrating at that point.  Perhaps this is what Roth wanted, or perhaps these characters are so similar, but there needed to be more differentiation between their voices.  Another issue is that there are so many new characters thrown at the reader but hardly any of them are developed enough, especially those who are meant to be the villains in this piece.  Perhaps if Roth had made this a longer book, or split it into four books, these characters could have been given their due.  Which brings me to my last issue with the novel.  There are so many climaxes among the various plots that the ending just feels way too rushed, especially considering the impressive beginning this series had.  It's been over a week since I finished and I think I am still in shock with the direction that Roth took this in.

If you wish to not know what happens, stop reading before the line of asterisks.)To me, Allegiant was exceptionally well-written. It's raw and feeling, and I think that this is the most Veronica Roth has ever put into writing. It conveys every emotion, and yes, some may argue that it's too harsh, but given what Insurgent set the scene for, such realism is to be expected. You can't have something build up and not get a big reaction from it. I personally think Allegiant delivered pretty well.The only bone I had to pick with Allegiant was the two-voicing feature the author put in. From Divergent and Insurgent, I'm used to hearing Tris's thoughts, and Tris's thoughts only. Now suddenly, I know mysterious, secretive, and brooding  Tobias Eaton's thoughts too? I get that he's  a real person and that Roth wants to show his vulnerability, but I think Ms. Roth just isn't used to writing in a male voice. Whenever I'm reading and I happen to skip over a chapter name that details if the story is currently told by Tris or Tobias, I'm confused until I see the word &#34;Tris&#34; or &#34;Tobias&#34; and know who's speaking. They just sound too similar. Their characteristics, actions, aren't as diverse as I would've hoped to see, and that kind of disappointed me.*****************************SPOILERS START HERE*********************************Okay, now I get why there were two voices. Obviously, someone had to close the story after Tris died. And I think that's where Tobias's perspective really shows through.And on Tris's death: Nobody wanted her to die. I get that. But in real life, the hero doesn't always get to live. Sometimes the hero is the one who gives up everything to save everyone. And  if Tris hadn't disabled the device that was going to brainwash her whole city, then her world would've been chaos. But you're thinking, &#34;Tris could've went with the original plan and let Caleb go in. Then everything would've been fine and we could still ship Tris Eaton.&#34; But really, would Tris still be the heroine we know and love if she just let her own brother die? With all the unselfish values her courageous mother taught her? The answer is no. We wouldn't love the book if that happened, either.

Yeah. I said worse. It is brilliantly written, imagined, and executed. I am honored to have been a part of these books.It&#8217;s hard to write a review for the finale book of a trilogy without giving away lots of spoilers, so I&#8217;ll keep my review short.The characterizations only get stronger throughout this book.

These characters are so well written that they become real life people, making good and bad choices, suffering and finding joy in awful situations.Tris and Tobias&#8217; relationship is so sweet throughout the whole book. They have REAL couple fights, not just &#8220;who loves each other more&#8221; fights. They get mad at each other, they lie to each other, they yell and they cry. But there is also a very deep connection between them that can defeat any obstacle they come across.

All my kids will read this book so they can see what they should aim for when they fall in love at 16.It&#8217;s like Veronica Roth came up with an idea for them, and then by the end of the series the characters had taken on a life of their own. Instead of the series ending happily, it ends realistically. This book demonstrates the terrible nature of war, the loss that comes with conflict, and the reality of sacrifice. It&#8217;s hard to read because of how accurate it is, but the accuracy makes it a more satisfying finish.I loved this book. I love the way it&#8217;s written. I love the characters.

{"reviewTime": "10 28, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I felt like I waited FOREVER for this book to finally come out!  I loved this series from page one of Divergent to the last page of Insurgent.  Then I had to wait again for Allegiant to come out.  I pre-ordered it months in advance and checked my mail box a hundred times the minute Amazon said it had shipped.  I avoided all reviews because I wanted to go into the last book with pure thoughts and my own ideas of what was about to happen to Tris and Tobias(Four).  After reading Allegiant, I would have to say I am a little disappointed in the writing of the book and even the way it ended but I will NOT give spoilers!! Sigh....Allegiant begins where Insurgent left off, with Tris and her friends locked up for participating in the uprising.  Tobias is Evelyn's right-hand man and also her son.  Evelyn is the new leader and is trying to bring everyone back under her control and rid the city of factions through brute force and any other means necessary.  While Tobias doesn't agree with what his mother is doing, he continues to follow her orders until he can find a way out.  Caleb, Tris's brother is also locked up and is awaiting his trial for helping Janine create and administer the mind warping drugs given to Dauntless to kill Abnegation people.\"He is a part of me, always will be, and I am a part of him, too. I don't belong to Abnegation, or Dauntless, or even the Divergent. I don't belong to the Bureau or the experiment or the fringe. I belong to the people I love, and they belong to me- they, and the love and loyalty I give them, form my identity far more than any word or group ever could. I love my brother. I love him, and he is quaking with terror at the though of death. I love him and all I can think, all I can hear in my mind, are the words I said to him a few days ago : I would never deliver you to your own execution \"\"To me, when someone wrongs you, you both share the burden of that wrongdoing - the pain of it weighs on both of you. Forgiveness, then, means choosing to bear the full weight all by yourself. Caleb's betrayal is something we both carry, and since he did it, all I've wanted is for him to take its weight away from me. I am not sure that I'm capable of shouldering it all myself - not sure that I am strong enough, or good enough.\"Tobias, Tris, Cara, Christina, Uriah, Peter, and a few others decide to leave and head to the fringe to find out what is out there.  What they find is the Bureau.  They find out that the Bureau has been monitoring them for generations and is doing scientific experiments to create the \"perfect\" human, not only in Chicago but across the country.  While at the Bureau, Tris and her group of misfits find out a lot of background history on their city and the many secrets kept from them and the others.  Tris finds out where her mother came from and that she was not born in the city but was actually placed in Dauntless by the Bureau as a spy.\"I take a deep breath. I'm not sure where that swell of desperation came from, but know that I've acknowledge it, it's impossible to ignore, like a living thing has awakened from a long sleep inside me. It writhes in my stomach and throat. I need to leave. I need the truth.\"\"Knowledge is power. Power to do evil...or power to do good. Power itself is not evil. So knowledge itself is not evil.\"Tris and Tobias have a hard time figuring out their own identity and where they belong as the secrets are unveiled.  Rifts and bad decisions begin to pull them apart instead of strengthening their bond.  Will the answers they are seeking bring them back together or will their bond break with more death and destruction than they can handle?\"Since I was young, I have always knownthis: Life damages us, every one.

She's gone, and crying feels so useless, so stupid, but it's all I can do.\"The disappointment in this book is palpable.

I lost it all. Ugh!!! :-( Well.....anyway....this is going to be the abbreviated version. It's just been &#34;one of those days&#34;.I would probably give this book 3.5 stars. I heard so many people talk about how horribly it ended, but I was ok with the way it ended. Was it sad? yes. Was it a surprise? not really. I knew something big was going to happen. I had thought it was going to be that everyone would lose their memories/be &#34;reset&#34; and have to start everything over again. What I DID have a problem with in this book was all the back and forth between this uprising and that uprising....good grief! I was SO over it. I had trouble keeping track with what they were &#34;going up against&#34;. I was fine with the first fourth of the book, but once they left the city and were picked up by Amar and that chick, I was done. It was SO anticlimactic once they got back to the compound and heard that the &#34;big revelation&#34; wasn't really the REAL revelation....and on...and on....blah, blah, blah. There were lots of little things that didn't seem to make since, or work. Like when they left the city on foot....apparently never to return....with only their clothes on their back. No food. No water. Nothing to help them survive indefinitely in a place they knew nothing about. Yah....that makes perfect sense. Or at the end when they set the memory serum off at the compound so that they could kind of &#34;reprogram&#34; all the people so that they didn't believe the whole GD vs GP thing (which I thought was weird and far fetched). That's good for those people, but doesn't the rest of the country/world believe in the GD/GP thing? So really, they didn't solve that problem. Also, throughout the series I kind of had a problem with big, tough, practically fearless Tobias scared of heights. Really?!?! That seems to be as likely as saying he was scared of spiders or something. And it seemed like this fear wasn't always an issue. Sometimes he was deathly afraid of being high up, but other times it didn't seem to be a factor. But again, my biggest problem with this book is the repetitiveness of the uprisings of this group and then that group. It was hard to keep track of, and I wasn't at all invested enough in all the various groups' problems to keep track of it all. :-\\There were a couple of things I DID like about this book. One thing was the heart breaking choice Tobias made after Tris was gone. The scene where he went back to his old house, cut his hair, and took out the memory serum. So sad. :-( Choosing between living with the unbelievable pain of loss and all the good and bad memories that go along with it, or forgetting it all, which means to have no memory of Tris....like she had never existed. Wow. So heartbreaking. And to have Christina be the one to help him walk away from this. I thought that was really cool. Very well written. The other part I liked was at the end with Peter. Peter was such an evil person, but for him to see this and want to change the direction of his life, I thought that was cool. I guess you could see it either way. You could see his action as being a coward, or being brave. I prefer brave. The funniest part of this was the way Tobias said that after Peter took the serum, he was so clueless about everything, and couldn't even remember his name after being told over and over again. That was a very UNPeter thing. Kind of poetic justice.So there you go.

It's dynamic, fascinating and moving. I truly enjoyed the story including the development of the romance between Four (Tobias) and Tris. The tale develops according to the personalities of the characters. True, I was sometimes disappointed in the portrayal of Four's fears and insecurities because I found them so hard to believe after reading the first two novels in the series. However, Tris emerges as a strong, mature character who bolsters him in every way because she loves him. Told from both viewpoints, the two narratives are linked in such a way that I felt the story flowed well. In short, as my reading progressed I found it hard to put the book aside.Leaving the city, to travel outside and discover the truth takes courage to face the unknown. When the group, led by Tris and Tobias, find another controlled society where the city is viewed as an experiment and the people within it as scientific subjects, they are not certain where to turn. And, because of the decision by the scientists to reset the city - start over - the group cannot bear to see the memories of their friends and families erased. Yet how can a group of newcomers change the outcome? Knowing that the scientists were responsible for so much of the chaos and death in the city they are determined to try to save the city. As the book comes to it climax I found myself running with these young idealistic young people so full of hope for the future.Yes, I thought this was an excellent well written novel. I'm glad I read it and believe that the author did credit to her story and the characters in the outcome.

If Roth was going to us this technique, her editor should have made sure the two narrators had two distinct voices. Next, the plot was pathetic, disappointing and felt like it was written by a different author to end a different story. I love sci-fi. I love dystopian novels. So I'm willing to buy into a certain amount of suspended reality. But this one goes off the deep end.

I know a lot of people complain about the ending, but sometimes, well-written and real life ending are extremely hard for some readers.*Book Details*Allegiant by Veronic Roth was published by Katherine Tegen Books in October 2013. It had 545 pages.The novel&#8217;s premiseTris and Tobias leave Chicago, everything they have ever known, and see the surrounding world only to find out the people outside their windy city are not quite as oblivious of Chicago as they were led to believe.*Point of View*Quality: Needs ImprovementSo in this third book, Veronica switches points of view between Tris and Tobias. This was not executed well. The only difference between the points of view was that under each chapter heading, the point of view character was listed: Tris or Tobias.This POV switching didn&#8217;t work well for me. After two books of exclusively Tris&#8217;s point of view, Veronica needed to write in some obvious tag at the start of each Tobias chapter. Multiple times I was pages into the chapter before I realized the point of view was Tobias&#8217;s.Also, I didn&#8217;t get the feel that Tobias had his own personality. In writing his chapters, Veronica really needed to give him his own voice. It seemed like we were getting Tobias&#8217;s point of view from Tris&#8217;s voice. To make matter&#8217;s worse, Tobias&#8217;s voice wasn&#8217;t exactly a man&#8217;s voice.*Editing*Quality: StandardI highlighted a single comma overuse issue.However the content editor should have helped with the point of view issues.*Imagination and Uniqueness*The imagination seemed quite limited. Veronica let us out of Chicago but she didn&#8217;t seem to be able to show us the world very well. We got to see a single government facility and a single fringe neighborhood.There were a lot of ways the outside world could have gone. Being stuck in a government facility the whole book, except for Tris&#8217;s single trip to the fringe, which while good, was not enough on its own.*Characters*This is the third book, so by now we are all familiar with Beatrice Prior (Tris) and Tobias Eaton (Four), and their budding romance. Though the relationship wasn&#8217;t as awesome as it could have been after last been when it seemed so stressed. There relationship was once again stressed.The addition of a few characters from outside helped this book along. However, Tris and Tobias remained the focus.There were a lot of side characters and that made it hard to focus on any particular side plot and this story really needed some better side plots.*eBook Quality*Quality: HighVery high quality eBook and extremely easy to read.", "reviewerName": "Rhyous \"Jared Barneck\"", "summary": "Veronica Roth must have iron writers armor", "helpful": [0, 3], "overall": 4.0, "unixReviewTime": 1393200000, "reviewerID": "A21QZAVXRQ2URF"}

Not in the sense that the ending is disappointing, but, well, it&#8217;s more than a little sad, with a bittersweet feeling that you don&#8217;t find in too many YA books of that genre.The story was told from alternating viewpoints, both Tris and Tobias getting first-person time in the spotlight. The voices were similar but still distinct enough to tell them apart without much trouble, and I loved reading Tobias&#8217;s narrative because his thoughts flowed in a way similar to my own, expansive and thoughtful compared to Tris&#8217;s energetic emotionally-charged viewpoint.Nature versus nurture was possible the strong theme running through this book, with the issue of genetic damage enhancing one characteristic at the expense of another, and that being what led to the experiment in forming the Factions. It was an interesting idea to play with, especially in that there was no final determination as to which played a larger part in a character&#8217;s personality. Genetic predisposition combined with upbringing as well as the general essence of a person all combined, and those who tried to insist that one side or the other won out were pretty quickly shot down. I liked that, since there&#8217;s a tendency to try for hard-and-fast explanations in most futuristic fiction, and those rigid explanations rarely stand up to scrutiny.Ultimately this was a powerful end to a powerful series, and I was glad to see it through even when my interest in dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction started to wane.

I was somewhat disheartened to find out they were in an experiment and there was the rest of the world outside the town.

I know that it isn't the strongest world building and some of the stuff is so far from real, but I like the spirit of the story so much I really let that go.  I enjoyed the idea factions and simulations and breaking out of your norms to be something more.Allegiant wasn't the book I hoped it would be.  Part of that is my fault of course for being so excited about it the other part is the direction the author took in the story.  It is a departure from some of the things I really loved in the first two books.  There is definitely not as much action in this one and some of the things that happened I thought were mistakes characters had already made in Insurgent and I thought they had already learned those lessons in a hard enough way they would not repeat them.That said the overall story is enjoyable I got to have some FourTris cuddle time and relationship development that I really liked.--  I fell in love with him.  But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me.  I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other.  I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.Seeing the world from both Tris's and Tobias's POV went well for me.  I knew Tobias was a flawed character so I wasn't surprised to see some of his struggles while others seemed a little off the mark.  There is a resolution of sorts with Caleb.  We get to see what is outside of the fence, it isn't at all what I thought it was.  Christina became a character I loved even more along with Cara.  There are new bad guys and new problems to deal with.  But the overall storyline just missed the mark with me a little.  It seemed a little like filler to get to the Big Event.I will say that the writing right before and after the Big Event is some of the best I've read from Roth and while I didn't like the direction the story took I respect that as the author that is where she chose to go and she at least wrote those parts beautifully.  The last 15% of the book is absolutely beautiful even if I didn't like where the story went.  But congrats to VR for doing something different with her story.My entire problem I think is that VR didn't make me believe in her ending.  I forgave some plot holes but the resolution between Evelyn and Tobias almost seemed like a cop out.  I did however like the arrangements between the Allegiant and Factionless at the ending.I will probably never read this one again even though Divergent is still one of my favorite books.  There is a definite ending and epilogue so we are not left hanging like in a few other dystopia trilogies I've read.Here is my silly math on how I came to my rating.  4 Stars for the commitment of the author to the ending she wanted, 1 Star for how I felt after finishing the book, 2.5 Stars for the overall outside the fence story line, and 5 stars for beautiful writing of the last 15% of the book.

What I really should have been trying to figure out is whether we were still good for each other or not.\"All the way home I thought about what Amar said, about every relationship having its problems. I thought about my parents, who argued more often than any other Abnegation parents I knew, who nonetheless went through each day together until they died. Then I thought of how strong I have become, how secure I feel with the person I now am, and how all along the way he has told me that I am brave, I am respected, I am loved and worth loving. \"And?\" he says, his voice and his eyes and his hands a little unsteady. \"And,\" I say, \"I think you're still the only person sharp enough to sharpen someone like me.\"I am,\" he says roughly.

That endinggggg :'(Let me start of by saying this book is very well written and it is a GOOD BOOK. However, I can't give it more than 3 stars, and this is why:First of all, I felt like this book took the series in a direction that it didn't need to go. I just feel like Divergent was filled with such amazingness of a new world and then Insurgent kind of veered away from it, but I was thinking maybe we would get more discovery of the factionless and that there would be more going on. What actually happened in this book, however, (no spoilers) was completely different. I just didn't like the way it went.Kind of along the same lines, I felt that when the story did take this turn and we find out about &#34;the experiment&#34;, it's like there's all this information shoved at us and none of it fits into what we've already read and fallen in love with. I just wanted to throw my Kindle a couple of times because I was frustrated. It wasn't the way I wanted it to go.The ending, in my opinion, was unnecessary. I don't mean that because of what actually happens (spoiler free), but of WHY and HOW it happens. It doesn't add up, it doesn't make sense, it didn't make me feel like the ending was justified to end that particular way. I've read books with similar endings where I understood it, but this one just made me angry and sad.The characters introduced in this book seemed kind of flat to me and didn't really serve much of a purpose other than to move the plot along, and in fact they kind of mirrored other characters. And the switching POVs was confusing several times for me, even after reading the name at the top, because Tris and Tobias apparently sound exactly the same in their thoughts. Not a fan.And my final point for three stars is not going to make sense to anyone who's not a romance fan, but that couch scene... WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED!? Like seriously, Roth, you couldn't give us some guaranteed assurance? No little snippet of a scene? Even Meyers gave us some headboard breaking sex, for pete's sake lol.

It felt cheap.Plus Tobias's mother just doing a 180 and saying OK, I'll end this revolt because my son gave me an ultimatum.  She was an extremist that wholeheartedly believed she was doing the right thing!  She even cut her son out of meetings and plans because she couldn't trust him or didn't think he was on board one hundred percent.And lets not overlook the fact that the memory wipe they did at the bureau would only effect that city.

Though not always a fan of Tris, in the first two books, I though Veronica Roth (VR) did a good job of creating a believable dystopian society and that she raised excellent questions regarding the nature of man and what kind of solutions might exist. I recommended the series to all my fellow readers. As I got into the third book, I wondered exactly how VR could possibly wrap everything up in just one last book. The expansion that occurred could have paved the way for a much longer exploration, but I was happy to think that at least Tris and Four would get their closure (and myself by extension)- and boy did they! Now, I'm not saying there must be unrealistic happily-ever-afters in dystopian settings, and I didn't expect this given the number of characters that were killed off in the first two installments. However, I DO expect in a YOUNG ADULT trilogy that if a couple's relationship is a main thrust of the story, they will at least get some kind of \"together forever\" as in the Hunger Games finale.I was so blindsided by Tris' end that I skimmed over the final 10% of the book still thinking she would have to come back somehow! Again, not my cup of tea, but if an author wants to do a stand-alone book with a tragic end for the lovers, I'm okay with that; but, to drag out the story for three books and THEN kill the protagonist (after conveniently inserting a second POV to facilitate this narrative) is completely ridiculous! I agree with the reviewer who stated the author broke the cardinal rule of romance (though I would insert YA trilogy as a more accurate category) as well as the trust of the reader. The fact that VR managed to get a movie deal BEFORE completing a trilogy is quite the accomplishment, but I for one, now have zero desire to relive the experiences of a girl who will soon be dead. What's the point? I have a feeling most audiences will agree and I will be surprised if the other books end up on the big screen. VR has lost me as reader. I will never again trust her to provide my fictional escape where I expect an outcome that is different from real life! Additionally, I found it ludicrous that the competent, well-respected Four is basically emasculated and becomes incapable of making a sound decision for a good portion of the book. What?!?!  And he is the one who lives?? Oh yes, along with a great majority of other secondary and/or non-admirable characters about whom I don't give a damn.

I can understand why Veronica Roth decided to go in that direction and chose that ending. The last paragraph was also very interesting and was a good last paragraph for that ending. It even seemed to me there was more of a religious type of theme to it. Bar all that... I felt very disappointed she went in that direction. The romance between Tris and Four was so excellent that I thought it was up there will all my other favourite romances, maybe even in second or third place.

{"reviewTime": "11 15, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW********************I'm going to attempt to be coherent here, but no guarantees.  I read this book straight through last night, staying up until well past midnight reading/crying.  I am so, so proud of how Veronica Roth decided to end it.  I think that killing off the main character is the bravest thing an author can do.  It takes guts to kill of a character who has been born and grown in your mind through such an eventful series, and tears aside (and there were MANY TEARS SHED), I'm kind of glad she did it.  This story needed to have an emotionally BIG ending, and it didn't disappoint.Other thoughts: you really couldn't have predicted most of the events of this book.  The beginning did seem to drag a lot in its lengthy information dump, and it was often confusing which side was what and why they did what they did.  The point was that everyone was morally complex and ambiguous, and I get that, but introducing a new big bad and making it so confusing got overwhelming easily.  I think that says more about me as a person than the book itself, as I think we humans are not very well conditioned to accept complexity.I'm so happy with the way Four's story was resolved.  I knew someone was going to die, and I hoped it wasn't him, and I'm really selfishly happy that, for once, the character with the tragic backstory doesn't have a tragic ending.  It's empowering to read a book where an abuse survivor is a main character and he comes out alright.  That means the world to me.  I am also extremely satisfied with the way Tris and Four's relationship exists in the story.  Unlike a lot of book couples, there was no overblown love triangle, and while there were certainly heightened emotions, there were a lot of meaningful discussions.  When a problem came up, either Tris or Four would pull their partner aside and mention that they should talk and proceeded to do so.  Talk about setting a great example for a healthy relationship, especially where one character has tendencies toward unhealthy relationships.  Again, extremely satisfying to see in a work of popular fiction.I honestly think this was the perfect ending to the series, but as it is with subjective opinions towards books, YMMV.  We may have lost a dear character, but as Veronica Roth has stated, this wasn't something she relished doing.  This was something that had to be done for the greater story, and that is something to be respected.This has been a good year for powerful, meaningful young adult novels.Thanks, Veronica Roth.", "reviewerName": "Runa", "summary": "Allegiant", "helpful": [0, 4], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1384473600, "reviewerID": "A2L2BHOKM9VTR1"}

I get that, but it was a realistic choice, and actually I applaud Veronica Roth because I am sure she knew there would be backlash. I actually liked the ending.Here's the thing, if you have read the first two book in the series, you SHOULD read the last one, and if you are thinking about starting the trilogy, you absolutely should because Divergent in particular is one of the best YA novels out there.The problem for me in this last book is that you are introduced to a world outside the city and it's never really clear what's going on with it. This is where a trilogy like Hunger Games really shines because Collins does a wonderful job introducing you to the world outside of district 12 along with Katniss.  I *think* this was Roth's intention but it didn't work at all for me (maybe because it's essentially crammed into one book that already has a lot else going on).  I still am fairly confused about what happened to the US re: genetic modifications and how the country is set up (is there a centralized government? Is it mostly genetically damaged people in all the cities? I'm just confused - could be because I was reading it at 2 AM).For a story that seemed so carefully planned out in the first two book, Allegiant seemed a little ad hoc at times. Tris's mom was able to just be dropped into Dauntless at age 15 and no one questioned where she came from? There was an effort to remove the divergent population but Tris's mom never thinks to remove her own daughter? Evelyn and Marcus just kind of come to an agreement? The diver gents are so important to the scientists and they just let the slaughter occur when they could have intervened with serum the whole time?

{"reviewTime": "10 23, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I literally JUST finished Allegiant and had to head out to see what others were saying about it. I was completely shocked to see all the negative reviews. Most of them I have to believe are provoked by the way it all ends, and I have to completely disagree with them. Tris' final decision makes perfect sense to me, given who she was written to be at her very core.SPOILERS AHEADFrom the way Insurgent ended, I knew we were in for a wild ride once Allegiant was in our hands, but I certainly didn't see the true nature of the dystopian world coming the way it did. Genetic manipulation and the chaos it caused leading the US Government to make some radical choices, allowing the pursuit of science and perfection to turn them into god. When that failed, their answer was to start all over by resetting the entire city's memories. Someone has to stop them. And of course Tris, our ever selfless heroine, does just that.Tobias, Christina, Marcus, Uriah, and the rest of the Allegiant cast journey though the discovery of the true reality of who they are and why the Factions and their city of Chicago are so important to those outside the fence. But it's the bitter reality of finding out his, and others, genetic makeup isn't perfect enough for the government that brings division and confusion to Tobias, even among his friends. Thankfully, this group is strong enough to believe in themselves, in who they are as people, without allowing those who think otherwise to divide them completely. At least not for long.Tris and Tobias continue to struggle through their relationship and they both make painful decisions but they are finally able to come to the understanding that life does that to couples. Just like in reality, they realize that holding a grudge against someone you love isn't the right answer. Life is painful, and the only way to survive the pain is to agree to give forgiveness before it's even required. And there is a lot to forgive in Allegiant.Tobias' poor choice leads to the eventual death of a friend, and Tris' wise decision leads to the ultimate sacrifice. Something all us readers should have seen coming. Painful and heart wrenching as it was to read, every character held true to who they were written to be. Having the book written between Tobias and Tris' point of views truly only made sense in the end, but that's where the real power in this book comes through. Dealing with the loss of war, rebellion, and the death of those who believe in the cause enough to give their lives for it takes the last chapters of this whole trilogy to a new level. Tobias' character is pushed to the limit, and we get front row seats as he shows us the real strength it takes to move past the loss of someone you love, and the courage it takes to allow those who've hurt you the most the opportunity to make things right.I do agree with those who are comparing this final book in the Divergent Series to Mockingjay of the Hunger Games Trilogy, in that, despite the tragic ending and saying good-bye to several beloved and vital characters, Allegiant, though horribly painful to finish, left me feeling much more satisfied and convinced that those who were left will indeed succeed. It was a brilliant end to the story of Beatrice Prior, and a fresh beginning for everyone who survived.It will be a long time before I can emotionally handle re-reading this series, but it will forever be one of my favorite book series to date.Thank you, Ms. Roth.

The book was extremely fast-paced with no lagging and overly drawn out internal monologues that have lately been overtaking the third books in YA series. There were no crazy last minute introductions of new characters that utterly destroyed the flow (sure there were new characters, but no one that really mattered or that we were suppose to get emotionally invested in)The Negatives: Was it just me or was the writing really easy, like juvenile fiction easy? There was nothing complex about it, just straightforward writing. Also, while I appreciated the dual points of view, I often found myself forgetting who I was reading from because Tris and Tobias had the same voice! There was no differentiation between the two, which is unacceptable. Take a note from Marie Lu if you want a perfect way to write a book from dual p.o.v.The ending: I'm mixed about this end. On one hand I understand why Roth did it, not romanticizing war, but also being brave herself as a writer to do something that would make over half of her fans cry foul and turn on her faster then Marcus Eaton would on..well..anyone. However, the fan girl in me says she only did it for shock value to get people talking about it and keeping the sales up. BUT, the first movie is already set for March with a fantastic cast so keeping the series relevant is not needed. Why not give the fans what they want?? I really don't think it would have taken anything away from the overall story or emotional journey she took us on with these characters. She already created the friction between Tris and Tobias with Tobias joining Nita and her crazy plan so the ending just seemed like more crap to get through.Obviously read this if you have invested time in the other two, but with the addition of this third book, the series as a whole just went downhill for me much like Matched and Delirium.

I dislike reviews that contain spoilers, so this one will not.  What I will say is that those of you loved Divergent and Insurgent should not expect Allegiant to be a carbon copy but rather more of a revelation.  If the reader dislikes science or the study of human behavior, or was waiting for nothing more than the culmination of a romance, you'll certainly find fault here.Chapters are divided between Tris' perspective and Tobias'.  I do agree with a previous reviewer that at times it became confusing, but that aside I think it was vital for Ms. Roth to write the book in this manner.  Allegiant is about many things -- strength, weakness, failings, character development, science vs human nature, and the survival or destruction of a society.  Nowhere can this be better understood than being inside the minds of Tris and Tobias, watching their growth, their failures, and their resurgence.  And that could only happen by giving them their own chapters, especially as they saw the unfolding world with sometimes different perspectives.  Separating characters by chapters must be a hard thing to do, but I think this author did a more than passable job. It was only my struggle to keep the chapters straight between Tris and Tobias that kept me from giving Allegiant a rating of 5 stars.I'm told there are rabid Divergent fans out there now who are completely tearing Allegiant apart shades of Kathy Bates character in Misery because they disagree with one particular turn of the story or are unhappy with the ending.  Anyone who truly understands the process of writing knows that characters belong to the author.  They spring from the author, from his or her imagination, from the heart.  Authors are filled with emotion for and commitment to their characters.  They feel every heartache, every wound, every mistake.  The characters in this trilogy were rich and memorable.  Dystopian novels are not meant to end on a particularly happy note.  In fact, the word \"dystopia\" means \"a community or society, usually fictional, that is in some important way undesirable or frightening.\"  (Wikipedia)  If readers begin a book like this wearing rose colored glasses, they're bound to be unhappy.  There may be other genres more their liking.I found everything about the ending to be right and meaningful.  It ended as it should have, the characters occupying the spaces where they needed to be, where they were destined to be.  Ms. Roth brought the story full circle, answered a myriad of questions, and while it was a very heavy read because of the subject matter, for me it was extremely satisfying because it kept me on my toes.

At one point we are told \"it has been a few weeks\" since an attack that occurs over halfway through the book, but it feels like four days, maximum. Later we are told there will be an attack in \"48 hours time,\" but I counted three days. Then we blast ahead 2.5 years and things are all out of whack.Next, the entire book beats us over the head with this \"be brave\" message. Over. And over. And over. And over. About sacrificing yourself for the greater good and blah blah blah. And it wasn't implicitly suggested at all, like a good book would've accomplished--no, we are TOLD, multiple times, about bravery.

You know, when things go EXACTLY ACCORDING TO PLAN? Yeah, that didn't just happen once, or twice...it happened throughout the entire book. And these weren't intricate, complicated plans. These were slashing tires and the guys driving the trucks don't even care. Like, seriously. I nearly put the book down when the driver basically said, \"Bummer. Oh well!\" Yeah.For the last part of my review, I'm going to focus on the dual-perspective between Tris and Tobias. IT DIDN'T WORK. Take everything you know about Tobias and throw it out the window. His personality COMPLETELY changes. He and Tris were VERY annoying. He literally describes EVERY. LITTLE. DETAIL. I'm not saying that people don't do that. I'm not saying he shouldn't. But those moments when he would take two whole paragraphs to describe the expression on someone's face? Yeah, completely unnecessary and boring. Tris was Tris. Together they were self-righteous, full of themselves, thinking they're the best things to ever happen in the world. And based on interviews, I feel like Veronica Roth feels that way about these books, too. She's not a humble author by any means, and that clearly leaked into this book.To wrap things up, \"Allegiant\" made me angry. It did. There was NO climax. Seriously, it DID NOT EXIST. This was the DIVIDE BY ZERO ERROR of books. I got to page 500 thinking, \"If the bullets don't start flying in the next paragraph, then this book was a complete waste of time.\" And guess what? The bullets never flew.If you expected an action-packed thriller like \"Divergent\" and \"Insurgent,\" you will be disappointed. Nothing big happens. No great power struggle. A let down of a finale.

The first book was lengthy and wordy but great! the second book was ok, but this last book was a major disappointment. Horrible ending to the series.  I agree with other reviewers--read the first two then make up your own ending. Because the ending Roth wrote will leave you feeling angry and frustrated with the time you spent falling in love with the characters in books 1&2.Spoilers!!!!!!After reading the first two books in a matter of days I couldn't wait to finally discover what was outside the fence. I was immediately  irritated by the way the third book was written. It was difficult to keep track of which characters point if view you were reading. At first I thought it was just me since I was quickly losing interest in the story line and characters. However, it's seems I am not alone. For two characters that had such spunk and determination they both ended up sounding like angsty, emotional teens! Tobias was a stong and courageous DAUNTLESS leader for crying out loud! In this book he sounds like a little girl! Very disappointing!Also very let down on how the author chose to wrap up the series. Tris dying served no point whatsoever. She magically is able to mentally over power the death serum that no one else is able to overcome only to be shot! Give me a break! Then to have her mom show up in ghost form and say its okary to let go and everyone will keep surviving. Please...how lame. The same girl that defied odds time and time again only to be shot dead is just pointless. The same ending could have occurred if tris lived. It's not like the characters outrage over her murder spurred them to make change. The Chicago expirment could have made the deal with the government and everyone could have continued on.Also frustrating was the whole genetic mutation story line. Was talking about the fringe really necessary? It just seemed like the author started a million other story lines to disguise the fact that her ending made no sense whatsoever. The characters could have actually thought out a more logical way to use the serum and the government could have used the serum to stop everything from happening in the first place! Instead of supplying Jeanine with the simulation serum why not just erase everyone's memory of the knowledge they wanted kept secret. And! If the divergent didnt need to help save the outside world why was that movie even made?! If the first prior knew they didn't need to save the outside world, because she came from outside the experiment, why did she make the clip in the first place?!

Divergent and Insurgent were written solely from Beatrice&#8217;s perspective making them easy to follow.However, Allegiant was written by alternating between Beatrice and Four&#8217;s perspectives. While reading, I found this very hard to follow at first as I was used to reading only from one perspective. But to be honest, once I got used to it, I enjoyed seeing the events from another perspective, allowing us to get to know another character as well as we came to know Beatrice.With books, I believe that the ending really can make or break its success.

It wrapped up the trilogy beautifully and gave readers something to think about.Overall, I believe that Allegiant is my favourite book in the trilogy!

It honestly felt like a different author had written this book, only this author was hell bent on including so many plot holes and tearing apart the faction world that had been created.

It's like he has had a complete character change out of nowhere. He is no longer able to process situations logically, gone is the intelligent instructor who is able to calculate his decisions and movements logically. Instead we are placed with a Tobias who doesn't take in the facts and make rational decisions. Seriously, this character change is ridiculously frustrating and honestly it doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't contribute anything to the plot but instead created unnecessary complications. On the bright side, Tris kicked butt in this book and she was still a really good heroine.Was I the only one getting slightly confused as I was reading? A lot of the time it was getting really complicated for no reason. I could've seen the book written in a way that had an interesting plot line but wasn't written in a complicated way. Sometimes it is possible for a book to be interesting and amazing without it being confusing and having so many gimmicks in order to interest us. One confusion was the fact that the book was split between Tris and Tobias' point of view, yet they were written in EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. I'd find myself re-reading chapters because I got confused in whose point of view I was reading. Another thing that really confused me was the fact that the characters in this book only suddenly thought about what was going on beyond the boundaries of the city of Chicago.

{"reviewTime": "11 9, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "SPOILERS &#8211; LOTS AND LOTS OF SPOILERS&#8216;Allegiant&#8216; was so incredibly bad, and the ending was the least of it.A lot of the things I had problems with have already been mentioned in other reviews, but I have to put my own spin on things.First, what the heck was going on with Four and Tris? Did they have a &#8216;Freaky Friday&#8217; moment and switch personalities, because seriously, Four was a whiny little girl. There were several times where I just wanted to yell at him to change back to the character I knew in &#8216;Divergent&#8217; and &#8216;Insurgent&#8216;. If this was supposed to be character development, well, it didn&#8217;t work. And Tris went to being one of the most selfish, self-serving characters I&#8217;ve read in some time. I know I was supposed to believe she was selfless, but I didn&#8217;t. Sorry. But not really.And the deaths?  I know its war time, but I seriously think the author was in a bad mood when she wrote those scenes because she killed almost everyone off, except the villains I noticed. Seriously, bad people do die in war too. They don&#8217;t get to take memory serums and live out their lives as if nothing ever happened. That part was just insanely bad.Okay, so another thing was the duo voices. And this is part of the reason why I don&#8217;t think it was edited very much and if it was, it wasn&#8217;t done very well. Tris and Four&#8217;s voices were identical. In fact, if it hadn&#8217;t been for the character saying &#8216;Tris&#8217; or &#8216;Tobias&#8217; I would have had to check to see whose chapter it was. And, as together as they were in the first two books, they were apart in this one.In &#8216;Allegiant&#8216;,  Tris and Tobias&#8217;s relationship seemed almost forced. There wasn&#8217;t the same connection. I know they kissed a lot, but they never seemed to talk to each other the same. There were scenes where there were serious issues between them and instead of talking it out, they spoke for five seconds and then made out.Then there was the info-dumping and the introduction of genetics. That introduced a whole new lot of problems for me. I was so disappointed that all the fantastic adventure and fun I had with the other two books came down to &#8216;damaged&#8217; genetics. That&#8217;s what it all boiled down to? That some people didn&#8217;t have perfect genes and didn&#8217;t think or act in the same ways as those who did, therefore they had to be confined in some kind of massive mental hospital, which just happened to be the city of Chicago? Isolated, watched and experimented on in the hopes they become &#8216;better.&#8217; Yeah.I know a lot of people have mentioned the ending over and over again. And I have to agree with them. I didn&#8217;t mind Tris dying, but it was the senseless, unrealistic way it was done. I know that I was supposed to get into the reasoning behind her decision to die, but all I felt was that Tris had a self-serving Martyr complex about her.The sad reality is I didn&#8217;t get emotionally invested in Tris&#8217;s death at all. It didn&#8217;t mean a single thing to me, because the way it was done was butchered. It was so unrealistic that I could have cried. She survived the death serum and then got shot? The same character who had survived several attacks on the compound? I would have believed in her death more, if she were killed in enemy crossfire.As for the mission they had getting into the building. I didn&#8217;t buy that either. You&#8217;re dealing with a world that can decide what memories you keep or lose, but they didn&#8217;t have or couldn&#8217;t invent a device that cracks codes or a powerful portable vacuum unit that could suck in and contain all the death serum? And Tris was running about in a war-torn country and she wasn&#8217;t carrying a gun? When she had been just chapters before? Too many variables for this death to be even remotely realistic.If you&#8217;re going to kill a main character off at least give it a realistic edge.Now don&#8217;t misunderstand me. I can appreciate sad endings when they&#8217;re done well. &#8216;The Faults in Our Stars&#8217; by John Green was done well. It was realistic and I could see it happening.  It quickly became one of my favorite books.  &#8216;Sever&#8217; by Lauren DeStefano was also another book where my favorite character had a sad ending, but that was bittersweet because instead of his ending coming to him surrounded by four walls, he had a chance to live. It made his ending special.All Tris&#8217;s death taught me is that a person can go through hell and back and that&#8217;s it&#8217;s just a waste of time, because the bad person is still going to win anyway. She should have just died with that first initial jump in &#8216;Divergent&#8217; for all her death meant to me in this book.Another thing that got to me about this book is that parents, ones that love and care about you, would not wish death upon you. The idea that a child would choose to die just because they think it would end up honoring the parent needs psychiatric help. Because that&#8217;s about as far from the truth as a person can get. Tris&#8217;s parents would have wanted her to live, especially when she had someone to live for.So all I get out of this is that Tris didn&#8217;t love Four, because if she had she wouldn&#8217;t have done what she had. She had her own agenda &#8211; one that instead of being selfless was actually one of the most selfish things I&#8217;d ever read. She didn&#8217;t give a damn about the people she left behind as long as she got to be the martyr. Everything&#8217;s for the greater good after all. It wasn&#8217;t like there wasn&#8217;t someone else willing to do it, regardless of their reasons, was there? No?  Oh, wait, I believe there was someone else who would have done it.Ha-ha I&#8217;m raging and I know it, but seriously there was no point to this character&#8217;s death apart from the author writing it that way. Senseless. Pointless. Meaningless. Weak.Anyway, I couldn&#8217;t help, but write a little ditty. Inspired by &#8216;Billy, don&#8217;t be a Hero&#8216; by Paper Lace. It&#8217;s a chorus and the ending of that song &#8211; only I&#8217;ve called it &#8216;Tris, don&#8217;t be a Hero.&#8217;  Somehow I thought it was fitting.Tris, don&#8217;t be a heroDon&#8217;t be a fool with your lifeTris don&#8217;t be a heroCome back and make Four the happiest guy (sorry that line a bit of a squash compared to the song)And as Tris started to goFour said, &#8220;Keep your pretty head low.&#8221;Tris don&#8217;t be a heroCome back to me&#8230;I heard there was supposed to be a reasonThat explained why Tris died that dayThe author wrote it as if Tris was a heroWe should be proud she died that wayI heard some readers threw the series away&#8230;", "reviewerName": "Sandy @ Craving YA Reads", "summary": "So many things wrong with this book - SPOILERS", "helpful": [9, 10], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383955200, "reviewerID": "A134TCTK1FZF2V"}

{"reviewTime": "12 6, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I probably need to say that this review will probably be a jumbled mess. Bear with me please. I don't normally feel the need to state this, but with all of the controversy surrounding this book, I want to make sure you know this review is spoiler free.I&#8217;m sure you all have seen tons of press about Allegiant. This was probably the most anticipated book of the year for most people. It definitely was for me. So I&#8217;m sure you saw the Allegiant countdown widgets on everyone&#8217;s blogs. I&#8217;m sure you saw dozens of Waiting on Wednesday posts about this. There was a mishap with some supplier somewhere and some people got copies super early, which means spoilers were leaked. And then release date finally came. Now normally, I go to my local book store and pick up books that I&#8217;m highly anticipating so that I can have them on release day, but the last one I bought was almost half price on Amazon compared to my local book store on release day. (Yeah, yeah, Amazon&#8217;s the devil. Well not to me. I heart Amazon.) And so this time I preordered Allegiant through Amazon instead of picking it up on release day. This meant that tons of people got their hands on Allegiant a couple of days before me. Enough time for spoilers to begin amassing, comments to begin piling up, and opinions began to be formed.And well, I say all of that to say that I was extremely nervous going in to Allegiant. I&#8217;m not normally one of those people who dreads reading the last book in a series just in case it doesn&#8217;t go the way I want it to. I&#8217;m more of the type that dives in head first because I can&#8217;t wait to experience it whether good or bad. But all of the hype and comments had me stressed to the max about this book. Let me be clear, I didn&#8217;t read any spoilers, but I did read some where others had read spoilers and based off the spoilers decided not to even pick up the book. All of this buzz and conflict had me a bundle of nerves. (Didn&#8217;t help that I was already having some anxiety over some real life things as well.)Ultimately I picked up and finished Allegiant. The beginning was going just fine. I wondered to myself &#8220;what are all of these people complaining about?&#8221; And then I hit the middle and I started getting frustrated with these characters *clears throat and cuts eyes* (**FOUR!!!!!). I really wanted to pop them him over the head. And I don&#8217;t know if it was the negative hype, my personal frustrations with characters making some really dumb decisions especially when those characters are supposed to be smart, or if it was my general anxiety, but during this part of the book, I really just wanted to throw the thing across the room. The ending wasn't the part that frustrated me the most. It was the middle. But nevertheless, I moved passed the frustrating middle business and things got better for me. And then the ending happened. I probably would have been frustrated with it had I not been warned that many people hated it, and therefore I lowered my expectations. But the ending really just wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal for me as far as getting angry or upset. It made me sad. I teared up, but I found the ending to be solid and acceptable.Four and Tris start off Allegiant in a rocky kind of place. She lied to him about several things in Insurgent, and so he&#8217;s got some trust issues based off that. But they have a talk about how they both need to do a better job being honest with each other, and so things get better. They find themselves on more stable ground.My favorite relationship oriented quotes:&#8220;We&#8217;re not people who touch each other carelessly; every point of contact between us feels important, a rush of energy and relief.&#8221; - Four&#8220;I Feel the urge, familiar now, to wrench myself from my body and speak directly into her mind. It is the same urge, I realize, that makes me want to kiss her every time I see her, because even a sliver of distance between us is infuriating.&#8221; - FourI was as I mentioned above extremely frustrated with Four at one point. He made a decision that was contradictory to a conversation that he and Tris had. Then he semi-rectifies it and talks about it with her. But he doesn&#8217;t listen to her. Turns out she was right. I know that&#8217;s a sticky place to be&#8212;situated between your own judgment and the judgment of someone else that you highly respect and trust. Truthfully I felt like the Four from Allegiant, and even Insurgent really, wasn&#8217;t the same person from Divergent. He felt like a completely different person. His mannerism. His speech. His attitude. His decisions. They all felt like they were coming from two different people. Maybe that was supposed to be the difference between him being Four and him being Tobias (I hate that name by the way). But I would think that Tobias would be a more complete person and Four would be just one side of himself&#8212;just the Dauntless side. But that wasn&#8217;t the case at all. Maybe the Tobias part is the part that carries the baggage from his past which weighs him down and causes him to question and doubt. Whatever the cause, and not just because of the name, but Four is a much more likable and understandable character than Tobias for me.One of my favorite aspects of Allegiant, and something that I don&#8217;t point out in books that I read enough, was the quotable moments that seem more like life lessons. Here are a couple of examples:&#8220;I need to deny them the power to control me. I need to know that I am stronger than they are.&#8221; &#8211; Four, discussing his fears.&#8220;And as I stare out at the land, I think that this, if nothing else, is compelling evidence for my parents&#8217; God, that our world is so massive that it is completely out of our control, that we cannot possibly be as large as we feel.&#8221; &#8211; Tris, which makes me think of Romans 1:20 (NKJV) &#8211; &#8220;For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.&#8221;&#8220;I feel like what I have become is halfway between my mother and my father, violent and impulsive and desperately afraid. I feel like I have lost control of what I have become.&#8221; - Four&#8220;So how can I hold Tobias&#8217;s desperation against him, like I&#8217;m better than him, like I&#8217;ve never let my own brokenness blind me?&#8221; &#8211; Tris, forgiveness&#8212;something this world could use a little more of.&#8220;I used to think that when people fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward. And maybe that&#8217;s true of beginnings, but it&#8217;s not true of this, now. I fell in love with him. But I don&#8217;t just stay with him by default as if there&#8217;s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.&#8221; &#8211; Tris, love isn&#8217;t just about how someone makes me feel, it&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s deeper, it&#8217;s harder than just that. Yet it is utterly simply at the same time.Other memorable quotes:&#8220;I sigh. I may like to run, but I hate climbing stairs.&#8221; &#8211;Tris, a throwback to the Abnegation days of climbing to the choosing ceremony from the very beginning of Divergent.&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to giggle...&#8221; &#8211; Caleb (you need the context to find this funny)&#8220;Be brave.&#8221; - FourUltimately I think that the Divergent series reminds me a lot of The Hunger Games series not just in concept, but in how I felt about both series as a whole. I LOVED the games. And I LOVED the Dauntless initiation process. But I hated the political part of both of these series. I disliked the whole war idea and taking down the corrupt government. While I do really love the idea of how much one person can make a difference, this side of the series&#8212;the war and politics&#8212;wasn&#8217;t what I fell in love with. I wanted more initiation. I wanted more Dauntless. While I love Tris and Four, I think I would have been happier with the series if we&#8217;d followed other characters through their initiation process rather than follow Tris and Four through the rise and fall of multiple corrupt governments. Whereas with The Hunger Games series, I loved both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire because both of these had a the games in them, I didn&#8217;t really like Mockingjay as much because it focused on the politics. Unfortunately for the Divergent series, Divergent itself was the only book in the series that focused on the initiation process. And therefore, both Insurgent and Allegiant felt lacking to me. I don&#8217;t typically read reviews before I write my own, but I broke my own rule in this case and I can&#8217;t think of a better way to describe this than she did. Jen from YA Romantics said in her review of Allegiant on Goodreads that Divergent felt more Dauntless and Allegiant felt more Abnegation. That&#8217;s the perfect way of describing these two books.The ending of Allegiant was very Abnegation&#8212;true Abnegation. I strongly wish I could discuss this is greater detail with you guys, but I can&#8217;t spoil it for anyone who hasn&#8217;t read it. I&#8217;m surprised I haven&#8217;t spoiled anything in this review as it is.Anyway, I think Allegiant gets 4 Stars. It&#8217;s still a well written book. It still sparked emotion within me&#8212;even if mostly anxiety. Have you read Allegiant? If so, what did you think?

Again, I have to confess that I am much older than the target audience. Because I don't have any children, I also don't know WHAT kids like.  But I read the first two books of the trilogy; I liked the first one and was disappointed with the second one. This third one was terrible. Insurgent started to get stranger and more improbable as each page was turned; the actions of the protagonists were more and more stupid and inexplicable. The inexplicableness and stupidity of the characters' actions rapidly progressed exponentially in this third, and hopefully last, novel of the trilogy. I don't think that even 12 year olds would be able to swallow the incredible stupidity of what the main characters did in this book. Imagine a 16 year old going to the White House, and the head of the NSA recruits this 16 year old stranger into the higher echelons of the most secret programs. Come on!! The worst things for me were: 1) There really was no true character development of the main characters. You never get to really know them, why they acted as they did. You would get a one sentence glimpse into their past, and then it was dropped. 2) There were huge numbers of dangling threads that were never tied up or explained-instead, some intriguing thing would occur, and then it was totally ignored and never explained. 3) The main characters decided to do the most stupid things in answer to some problem-it was always a split second decision, with no analysis. 4) The romance between the two main characters was as boring as could be!! That is a BAD thing!! This author is newly married, so you would think she would have some idea of passion and love! If her marriage is as boring as the romance in this book, there is little hope for it. Now, I know that this is written for a young audience, so no one wants to read pornography. However, these 2 characters have NO chemistry at all. Snooze....Overall, my recommendation is for anyone thinking of paying real money for this book-instead, go to the reviews and read Penny's review. Her review is much more exciting than this book was. Penny also gives a synopsis of the novel, so you can know what happens.

{"reviewTime": "12 29, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Oh man. Ohhh man. I read Allegiant the week after it came out; but I've been stalling on this review up until now.The reason why is simple: because I've invested so much love in the Divergent series, and, like a parent whose kid brings home a less than satisfactory report card, I'm not angry with Veronica Roth after finishing it. Just disappointed.I guess it's worth noting that a common trend in dystopian YA trilogies is a significant dip in quality from the first book to the second; and again from the second to the third. Even the massive juggernaut that is the Hunger Games trilogy suffers from this problem: if Mockingjay had been the first book in the trilogy, I guarantee you that it would not have become a global phenomenon. And maybe it was stupid of me, but I really, really hoped that Allegiant would be different.I mean, Veronica Roth really seemed to care about her world and her characters. There was such a sureness and a sense of purpose in her writing, like she truly knew what was going on and wasn't just making it all up as she went along. I was so excited for her to pull back the curtain on the warring factions and show us all the corrupted glory behind it - and yet when the time came, she didn't deliver. Not even a little bit. In fact, I can think of literally nothing about this novel that didn't disappoint me in some way.Tris and Tobias' alternating perspectives sounded great in theory, but in execution, it quickly became clear that not only was this not helping the story, it was actually damaging it. Roth's weaknesses were on display as I found myself flipping back to check who was talking every time there was a chapter break - that's how indistinguishable the main character's voices became. As for the rest of the characters; well, the less said about them, the better - either they fade into the background, meet some undeserved fate, or become completely 2-dimensional.The plot, too, is underwhelming; serving up some heavy-handed allegorical lessons without the gutsy, meaty fun that accompanied the original clash between the five factions. Everything I as a reader believed to be important to the world of the series was systematically stripped away and devalued; and not in an awe-inspiring way. Instead, it just left me feeling confused, sad, and very much alone - rather like the characters who manage to squeak past Roth's merciless death count.The only thing that truly stands out about Allegiant is its ending, and all that served to do was put the entire series in a new, depressing light. Some people might say that what she does is a bold move, but in reality it's just like the rest of the book: unfocused, heavy-handed, and ultimately empty.The sad thing is, the Divergent series used to be my absolute favorite. Now...well, I'm not even sure if I'll see the movie.

{"reviewTime": "10 26, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "First off, while I haven't reviewed them on this site, I've read each of the other books in this series several times over. I adored both of the novels and each of the Four-centric shorts we've had. Allegiant, however, left me feeling a little flat. I'm not somebody that needs a happy ending to enjoy a book. Some of my very favorite novels end with a tragedy, and I honestly feel that, if done well, it usually makes a story better than a pat, happy ending. In this case, though, I think it was to the book's detriment. There were both good and bad parts, and I purposely let this review stew for 24 hours so I could make sure my opinion didn't change as I thought it over. Unfortunately, like most of the reviewers so far, I thought there was more bad than good, but I couldn't bring myself to give it only 1 star when I loved the rest of the series so much.***Spoilers***First, the good.- It started off very well. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning sections of the book.- I liked the Tris/Caleb arc (at least, until the ending). There was one scene in particular that touched me.- I enjoyed learning more about Tris's parents. Natalie is probably my favorite character at this point.- There was a lovely moment between Tris and her mother.- I liked that the relationship between Tris and Four was realistic. They argued, they forgave each other, neither of them was perfectly right or perfectly wrong, etc. I don't think there's enough of that in YA literature, and it was really good to see Four telling Tris off for the way she was acting. She deserved it, and it was nice that the author didn't try to pretend that the way she was treating him was okay.- It was good to see Peter, one of my favorite characters in the series, attempt to somewhat take responsibility for his actions and do something to change, even if it didn't work.- I appreciated the setting of the epilogue. It was satisfying to see Four finally facing his fears and jumping off the Hancock Building, and if they had to dump Tris's ashes anywhere, that was probably the best place to do it. He really did face his four fears in much more profound ways than by simply revisiting his fear landscape over and over again, but it's hard to love that growth he showed when he still ended up shattered and alone.- There were some interesting ideas about love, forgiveness and sacrifice presented, and I love when a book makes you think a little as well as entertains you.Unfortunately, that was pretty much all of the good. Now for the bad.- The pacing was off, and the flow of the narrative was choppy. I was surprised, because it was a little jarring, compared to the other books.- Characterizations were all over the place. So many of the actions they took in this one didn't feel true to their established characters at all.- As has been mentioned by a ton of other reviewers, Four and Tris have the exact same inner monologue voice. They're indistinguishable from one another.- The new characters introduced in this book were pretty unlikable, even the ones we were supposed to care about. And Caleb was even more despicable in this book than he was in the last one, which is really saying something.- The book was far, far too reliant on the different serums. There should have been much more to the story than just that. Beyond that, a great deal was made of Tris's immunity to them. She even inoculated herself against the death serum, something that nobody in the world had been able to do up until that point. And yet, it was never explained how that was even possible. Why was she was able to do that when nobody else could? What made her special or unique? That answer is never given.- There were several threads that were started and then immediately dropped, going absolutely nowhere. The editor of this series and I have a mutual friend, so I happen to know that she (the editor) was going through a career transition during the final editing process of this book, but I'm really surprised that the book was released in this state, with all of these problems everyone is pointing out. I'd be interested to talk with her and find out why she gave so many of these ideas the green light when they're executed so badly.- There was far too much of the wrong kind of exposition and very little action. Because of this, there wasn't any tension in the story. It felt like 2/3 of the book was filled with one long-winded explanation after another, and yet, somehow, we still didn't get the full backstory.- We didn't get the full backstory! The explanation for the Chicago/Faction experiments that the characters (and readers) were given was proven to be full of holes, lies and half-truths, and yet, it was the only one they ever got. In all of that exposition given, Ms. Roth never bothered to explain the real story, or even why the lies were told in the first place. It was explained away with a character musing that \"these kinds of things always have more than one reason behind them.\" That's not an answer. If the author couldn't even come up with a plausible explanation for how things got to the point that it did, how are we even supposed to take her world seriously?- The two earlier books made a great deal out of Divergence and how unique and special it was. In this book, we learn that Divergence really just means that you're completely normal. That was a total, complete letdown.- Peter's ending actually supported David and the government's point of view. He took the memory serum, wiped himself clean, and in the epilogue, it says that most of his old behaviors returned. If it wasn't his experiences or the way he was raised, if it was just who he was always meant to be, then they were right: his genetics caused his bad behavior. That one sentence right at the end negated the entire premise of the book.- The main characters, our \"heroes,\" did a horrible, horrible thing in order to win, and they brushed it aside like it was nothing. Most of the book was spent moralizing against using the memory serum to wipe people's memories without their consent, essentially erasing them from existence. When they found out that the Bureau was going to use the memory serum on the innocent citizens of Chicago, what was their solution? To use the memory serum on not only the bad guys working at the Bureau, but all of the innocent people working there as well. Four was the only one to object at all, and when he pointed out the hypocrisy of their plan, that doing it made them no better than the people they were trying to stop, his concerns were brushed aside with, \"We don't have time to come up with something else, and hey, better them than us!\" That was their rationalization. Better them than us. Think about it for a minute. Let's say that one country's government decided to blow another country off the map. The second country found out a day in advance, and decided that instead of trying to fend off the attack or negotiate or something, they would launch an immediate pre-emptive strike, and destroy the first country and all of its innocent citizens instead. Or, to use a real life example, look at the Germans during WWII. Many of them knew about the Nazi concentration camps and what was going on there, and that was their exact reaction: \"It's horrible, but it's better than it happens to them than to us.\" Looking back on it now, they're seen as cowardly or callous monsters. How is that okay? That moral relativism really bothered me. Like, a lot. I can't ever look at the characters the same way again, because it really damaged my view of them. Something that terrible is not okay just because it's the only idea you can come up with. Four was right: in the end, they were no better than the bad guys. How are you supposed to root for characters like that? The author either should have come up with another plan, or shouldn't have spent the entire book talking about how horrible it was to do something like that, right up until having her main characters do it. The fact that we like those characters doesn't make their behavior acceptable. In fact, it makes it worse.- Tobias ends up alone and broken, a shell of the person he once was. Yes, he faced his fears once and for all, but as I said, it's hard to care when he's left struggling just to exist.- The death. As I said, I'm fine with deaths in literature, if they serve a point. This one didn't. Yes, it did bring up some interesting points about love and sacrifice, but those exact same arguments could have been presented by another character's death. Uriah, if Roth was going to kill him anyway, or Caleb or Christina. Instead, Tris sacrifices herself again. Yeah, it's true to her character and it makes sense that she'd do it, but if the author was going to inoculate the character against the death serum, then why shoot her afterward? That was just pointless. She already made her sacrifice when she took Caleb's place, so there was no reason to kill her afterward - especially when it didn't change anything at all. There were still GD rebels waiting to attack. Outside of Chicago, the world was still exactly the same. Tris'd entire death, the sacrifice she made, it was all meaningless. I was left feeling flat and disappointed, just like so many other readers. I honestly feel cheated by it, which surprises me. The hope was completely gone. If Tris's death served a purpose, or if Four died with her or something, I could maybe find a way to be okay with it. But this? No. It was just wrong. It didn't add to the story, it detracted from it.So, all in all, this was a disappointing end to a great series. There were far too many things that needed to be changed for the story to go out on a high note. It was like the massive letdown of reading Mockingjay or Breaking Dawn all over again. It could have been amazing. The author is certainly capable of it.

So I came into it a little sad, thinking that this last one was going to end on a cliffhanger like Requiem or Mockingjay. So I waited and waited, and I just finished the book and you know what? It was amazing.First of all, I love how unpredictable these books are. It's like we learn something important in the first book, and we believe that it's true because Tris and her people do. Then in the second book, we learn that what we thought was true was actually...only half of a truth. So throughout this whole series, I came to realize that people lie a lot and a lot information gets twisted around-they only give us partial truths. Maybe I am not as clever as everyone else who \"saw it all coming from the beginning\" but there was so much information to absorbed, and it was amazing and crazy and I loved every moment of it!THE FEELS ARE STRONG in this last book-there is so much tension and hatred within the characters, but there were also moments of strong love and forgiveness that I couldn't help but get pulled under by. Veronica Roth is spectacular, and she makes me feel such strong, vivid emotions for these characters as if I knew them in real life. I never once thought \"oh these are just made up people, they don't exist\" because reading this series from the beginning, there is no way not to get attached to these characters. I cried so much in this book, more than any other book I have read...in my life. I love these characters, and they will always stay with me.The dual narrative was great, and I understood what Veronica Roth meant when she said that Tris' point of view was too narrow for this last book. I like seeing a whole different side of Tobias, he's strong despite his insecurities and I love him now even more than I did in the first two books. It kind of annoyed me when people saw him as whinny in this last book because looking at his background, it was obvious from day 1 that he was never as strong as he made himself to be, and it isn't until he admits his insecurities that he really does become strong.I just wanted to say to those people who gave this book a 1 star review: Have you ever read a one star book? Those are ones that are so bad that you can't even finish them. I get why people are upset, I mean, come on, that ending was like being stabbed in the heart repeatedly, it still hurts even after I closed the book.

I saw the big reveal at the end of the second booking coming from a mile away, but sometimes guessable plots are something we deal with in YA novels, and so I didn't think too much of it. I was not excited for this book, but when I was bored the other night I decided to purchase it. I was SHOCKED at how many bad reviews it had and thought it must be a fluke, so I purchased the book.... (Spoilers past here!)Allegiant starts off with a good feel and set-up. The old way has fallen. Tris and Four are still on the rocks. There is a looming outside world waiting for us. What will we find? Will our heroic couple make it or fall apart?  If we ignore the switch between Tris and Tobias (Which, as other reviewers said, is hard to read because you can barely tell their tones apart, and often I would skip reading WHO was narrating the chapter and find myself confused until they spoke about the other person), this is the best part of the book, in my opinion. It all goes downhill when they actually visit the outside world. The big reveal of the outside world falls short. As a reader, I was amped up and ready for SOMETHING. Instead, much like the characters, we are left with chapters and chapters of limbo. In dialogue, we even get something along the lines of &#34;We haven't really been sure of what to do with you guys and we think you haven't been sure either.&#34; That's how the book feels! Limbo. The genetic stuff seems dull, because there is little set up of it. We don't really get to feel the affects of the divide in this outside world, we're just given a glimpse and told it sucks, so we should be behind ending it. As I trudged through the pages, waiting for something exciting to happen, I realize that the reason for the POV shift is because Tris is going to die, but the story is going to continue after her death. And she does and it does. And it's all so BORING.All in all, I feel like this had a lot of potential, but it felt rushed and sloppy. There was action, but not enough world building for us to care about it.

They follow the same plot and you can sort of see everything that is going to happen.  Whenever a book deviates from that and surprises me I'm usually really happy.  I think that really is impressive on the writers part to break out of the mold and tell a really new story or have a really different perspective.

I did like getting inside Four's head and seeing the difference in how the two of them saw the world.  But, their relationship was sort of weird.

{"reviewTime": "11 8, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "First off: Spoilers. There will be lots in here. Well actually, only one, which is really what it all comes down to, and which, I suspect, is going to make this series both notorious and wildly successful for the foreseeable future. And btw, I gave this 2 rather than 1 star because it kept me reading till the disastrous ending, which must mean something. But anyway, about *that* ending:First of all, I don't call the ending disastrous because it's tragic. There are novels with devastating endings built on tragic love stories that I've nevertheless loved - \"At Swim, Two Boys\" and \"As Meat Loves Salt\" come immediately to mind. Or in the YA realm: \"The Book Thief\" or \"The Sweet Far Thing\" or \"The Amber Spyglass.\" Yet while I loved all of those books, I hated \"Allegiant\", to the point - two stars not withstanding - where I wish I'd never read it.As a writer, that's something I don't say lightly; in fact I don't think I've ever said it at all, about any book. And the thing is, I don't hate it because Tris died. I get the Christ analogy. I get that sacrificing herself to save everyone she loves is the obvious culmination of being both Abnegation and Dauntless. Thematically it makes perfect sense, and executed differently, it might have made a poignant ending, rather than one that made me wish I could scrape it out of my head. What it killed it for me is that the story wasn't strong enough support the death of the main character, and in so many ways that there really isn't any room for equivocation.To begin with, the plot was riddled with holes. For instance (and ignoring the most ridiculous ones) what good is it going to do to 'reset' this one facility to forget their prejudices and save the memories of another small group of people, when there's no evidence that the rest of the world isn't working on the same prejudiced principles, doing the same thing? None of the kids plotting the insurrection have been any further than the GP facility. What do they really know? And then, who exactly is left in Chicago for the reader to care about, once the main characters have left? If Tobias had been left behind, and was in danger of being reset or killed or whatever, then I could have begun to understand Tris's choice. But condemning him to grief and misery because It's The Right Thing To Do and My Brother's Doing It For the Wrong Reasons? It doesn't wash.Speaking of characters: none of the supporting cast is particularly well fleshed out, and as a result I didn't really care about any of them. The relationship between Tris and Tobias was the reason I kept reading. So take that away, and yes, it feels like a betrayal. In fact I'm guessing this is the root of most of the vitriol over this ending - not that Tris died, per se, but that the reader isn't left with anything redeeming to look to, any bright spot amidst the loss. All we get is a Tobias more broken than he was already, and a society that's miraculously healed within two years of its extremely virulent problems. And that's a pretty paltry offering when you've invested nearly 2000 pages in a love story.I also resented the gap between the gain and the enormity of Tris's sacrifice (never mind that she was doing to one group of people exactly what they'd planned to do to another.) Maybe the future of humanity did depend on 'resetting' the scientists, but if so, the evidence eluded me. It read as if Tris died for the dubious honor of re-educating a building full of bigots, and for the love of her wishy-washy brother who tried to kill her. Why? What about her love for Tobias, and his for her? What about his brokenness, and how much he needed her to be whole? And then, there's a whole world beyond the research complex that she knew nothing about, except by hearsay, and that, therefore, could easily have undone what she died for the next day. It all left me mentally screaming: 'Whyyyyyy?'But the deal-breaker for me comes not in the writer-analysis, but in the mommy-analysis. I have an 11-year-old daughter who is a very precocious reader. And while I generally don't censor what she reads - 'The Book Thief' and 'The Mortal Instruments' and 'Ender's Game' are some recents - I would never give her this book, for the simple reason that the main and most identifiable female character, who is otherwise actually a pretty decent role model for young girls, dies to save someone who really doesn't deserve it. Liberal commie-mommy that I am, I can't bear to propagate the attitude that women's primary value is in giving to others at the expense of themselves. Yes, selflessness is admirable, and necessary if we aren't all going to sink back into the Cosmic Soup. But angsty, dramatic, half-baked heroics? Spare me.", "reviewerName": "S.

Insurgent wasn't as good as Divergent, but it was still a good book and worth reading. I don't typically like it when an author switches from first person point of view to include others, after they have established a first person POV in previous books, and it doesn't work here because both POVs sound the same and it got confusing. (Obviously, now we know why it was done considering what happens. Ugh.) But I found myself skimming through paragraphs because I was losing interest less than halfway through it and that is not a good indicator of a 4 or 5 star book. When they finally get outside the fence and learn about the GPs and GDs and what was really going on, it proved to be anti-climatic and contrived, in my view. All that buildup and it just wasn't very exciting.Four was irritating to me, I didn't feel any sympathy or investment in his character, or in their relationship. There were too many new characters introduced and not enough with the characters from the previous books, like Christina. (Not like there were many left from the other books that she hadn't already killed off. Just about everyone is dead by the end of this series, it seems like.)SPOILER:Sorry, but you don't create a whole world where everything is told and shown by the main protagonist/heroine and then KILL her off in the last book. We hear everything from Tris's POV from day one, we are invested in HER, emotionally, and then you have her die? Gimme a break! Horrible choice by the author.

There was too much of this new part of the world to really get into properly and it didn't match the level of discovery and tension the first two books had.  The interesting world she created and developed in books 1 and 2 was clumsily added to with no finesse or respect to the characters.  The whole conflict boiled down to a terrible experiment left to go on way too long with no actual purpose that justified the end.  How long were they really willing to wait for pure genes?  People outside the bureau went on with their lives. More time should have been better spent trying to rehabilitate the individuals left to make better citizens and teaching them real skills instead of such a timely and costly experiment where they keep failing at it.

I'm still a fan, but here are my general thoughts (no spoilers!):1. I was not a fan of the ending. I can see why it ended this way, from a writers perspective, but from a fan/reader, I was bummed. One good point, is Roth tells us what happens to characters after the climax of the story, it doesn't just &#34;end&#34;, so there is a sense of resolution.2. The book is written from both the view of Tris and Four, and the chapter title indicates the individual. I thought the dialogue was not quite distinctive enough between the two. I was able to tell the difference based on plot lines, but the two perspectives felt very similar.3. Thankfully, it DID feel like the characters had grown up and matured a bit over the course of the series. In this book it seemed like they are accepted their flaws a bit, recognized their shortcomings and attempted to grow beyond them. Some series (twilight, ahem...although I am a fan) it always felt like they were wining about the same old thing from book to book. At least Roth seemed to evolve through some of these issues a bit.4. I am older than the target market, so of course I hoped for slightly more descriptive scenes between Four and Tris, but the romance scenes were very appropriate for the target audience, so I can appreciate that.I will be curious to see what Roth does next.

I&#8217;ll just jump into it, but don&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s a little&#8230; jumbled.Instead of writing a quick summary of the book per usual, I&#8217;ll just show you the Goodreads version:The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered&#8212;fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she&#8217;s known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.But Tris&#8217;s new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human nature&#8212;and of herself&#8212;while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.This is bad. Really bad. I didn&#8217;t even have enough heart to write a quick summary. This book&#8230; is just something else.Allegiant. The third and final edition in the Divergent trilogy. This book is a little different from the others. It shows both Tris&#8217;s and Tobias&#8217;s point of view. This take was interesting. I enjoyed finally getting into Tobias&#8217;s head. But, I didn&#8217;t really feel like I was viewing the world from his eyes.In the changes between characters, the writing style never changed. It was difficult to remember who I was looking into. For instance, sometimes I&#8217;d be reading, completely believing to be thinking like Tris, and then Tris will come into the scene. It confused me greatly throughout the whole book!! I could not figure out who was who, which I feel kind of ruined the book for me.Another problem: the book was boring. That is just that. Boring. There was an absence of fight scenes, and the exciting Dauntless life was no longer a factor. This made the characters seem dull and lifeless. I had no connection whatsoever to any of them&#8211; including Tris and Tobia&#8211; in Allegiant. It reminded me of Mockingjay, the last book of the Hunger Games trilogy. Both books had a rather dull ending, even though they were supposedly the final battles of a world altering revolution. There should have been tears and triumphs and a whole entanglement of emotions. Instead, I just happened to read a rather dull book without any connection to the problems at all. It was as if I hadn&#8217;t fell in love with the first two books during the summer in the slightest. This book turned out to be a dud.~*WARNING SPOILER ALERT WARNING SPOILER ALERT WARNING SPOILER ALERT WARNING*~OH MY GOSH. The ending completely blew my mind. Except, I didn&#8217;t enjoy it AT ALL because the rest of the book was so insipid! You can&#8217;t slap a terrific ending on the last couple chapters and have the rest of the book be so unexciting. It&#8217;s crazy! The main character ***BIGGEST SPOILER EVER DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN&#8217;T ALREADY READ THE BOOK*** dies. Tris collapses due to some measly bullet wounds shot by a guy in a wheelchair! Let me just tell you how magnificent I think this is.This is not necessarily a new concept, but it is one that authors hesitate to use. You can&#8217;t get readers so attached to the character, especially in first person view, and then kill them. That is practically killing your readers! Veronica Roth pulled it off in a dramatic, but entirely ordinary way.Ordinary. Getting shot in a revolt is  a common way to go. Tris isn&#8217;t special. She is an ordinary girl fighting for what she thinks is right. She doesn&#8217;t get some big send-off. She doesn&#8217;t get an extravagant death. She doesn&#8217;t get unique treatment. I feel like this is a brilliant idea. Roth has taken a powerful character with some quirks and some bad points, just like everyone else, and plopped her into a situation where she now has to be the leader, which is like a multitude of other books. Unfortunately, not everyone wins the battle. Not everyone continues on to live a fruitful life of happiness and can remember the revolution as &#8220;the glory days.&#8221; People die, and it isn&#8217;t just the minor characters. Instead of just telling us Tris is a normal girl, she is showing us Tris is about as ordinary as it gets. She even dies in a simple skirmish between her and another man. No one else was around. It was just her, and she failed. End of story.Sure, its a fabulous idea. For me, considering the whole book didn&#8217;t live up to my high standards, the scene didn&#8217;t faze me. I just thought, okay, wow, she&#8217;s dead. I wonder how Tobias will take this. No emotion at all. Let me tell you, if Harry Potter died, I would sob. I would sob and sniffle and crawl into my bed and refuse to emerge for days. Tissues would litter my room and I would withdrawal from public life. It would be like one of my best friends dying. In my mind, nothing compares to Harry Potter, but I was pretty connected with Tris and her life throughout the first two novels. In this one, the plot was uninteresting and it was all around unappealing, so I couldn&#8217;t even enjoy the revolutionary ending.I&#8217;m probably being too harsh, per usual, but I&#8217;ll tell you some external factors that may have made me loathe the book as much as I do. And I don&#8217;t really loathe it. I just wasn&#8217;t impressed by the ending when I know I should have been. I read this book between books, first of all. I started, then stopped, then started again. I despise doing that. And, I read it on my phone. Not a Kindle or anything, a phone. I have to say, the tiny screen and miniature &#8220;pages&#8221; didn&#8217;t help my reading comfort, which I feel has a lot to do with the enjoyment of the book.This book was a big miss for me, but like I said, that is for a multitude of reasons. I just felt the ending was completely anti-climatic. I wish I cried and screamed and threw my phone at the wall in absolute bafflement. But I didn&#8217;t. I read it and moved on. It was a fine book, it just didn&#8217;t live up to the other two nor did it make a mark on me. My favorite books are always the ones whose themes and plots and characters stick with me for a while. This just didn&#8217;t stick.[...]", "reviewerName": "Sharon Schilling", "summary": "Fabulous Ending, but Disappointing Middle", "helpful": [1, 1], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1388793600, "reviewerID": "A3B9FCQXSZX7V4"}

{"reviewTime": "12 23, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed the first two books, but this one seems completely out of place. The plot-- omg, the plot... was most of that even relevant? And a lot of the storyline had so many holes that it just couldn't stand up on its own. She made Stephanie Meyer's idea of making a teenage werewolf fall in love with a talking baby sound more sensible than half this book. Don't bother unless you like confusing and disappointment because that's all you'll get. It's best to stop at book #2 and dream up your own ending.Let's look at how this book fails: structure, plot, and the ending.The first two books were good, but this last book became progressively lost as Roth grasps for a cohesive story. We can ignore the many grammatical errors and simply focus on the structure of this final book. It lacks the fluidity of the first two novels and shifts from one characters perspective to the other so frequently that it's difficult to remember who is narrating. Especially since she doesn't give Tobias his true voice. He and Tris sound like some person-- neither carries an individual tone as the narrator. And I LOVED Tobias-- he was a great character until he became some weird, wimpy teenager in this book and both characters became almost annoying. And the dual narration serves no point, except for the ending. You learn nothing new about anything by having both characters as narrators. They are in the same setting most of the time and have the same friends and both of them pretty much do the same thing - be sneaky, make plots, makeout and get into trouble. I found myself constantly flipping to the first page of each chapter to figure out who was talking.She doesn't even stay true to the characters she built in the other two novels-- making them do things which are out of their nature. It drove me INSANE. Did anyone ever think Tobias (the careful planner who was always skeptical) would just join up with some group for the hell of it to take down a government without knowing details or asking questions? No. How about Tris's willingness to sacrifice her brother? She's suddenly now okay with guns because they are lighter and feel different than the other guns the Fractions used? Hmph.And how about the ENTIRE group losing all common sense:A) Who was dumb enough to think she would let her brother die voluntarily? Apparently everyone else in the story so they let her escort him to his death mission alone. Yeah. That's smart.B) Everyone saying it's okay to send a kid with ZERO military experience to go on a solo mission to blow up stuff and possible get into a gun fight when everything depended on his success? Seriously? These people are supposed to be \"military experts\" and they pick him for this super critical mission. That's believable.C) Christina says she has to pee and jumps out the truck, then slashes BOTH back tires so they can do some sneaky side mission. OMG! Flat tires! Tobias tells the driver they are both flat and he's like \"oh, that sucks, but that's totally plausible. Let's just split up on foot.\" Uh, anyone would wonder why both tires were flat-- I think he'd go look and notice the slashes. Dumb. Just dumb.This novel drags more than the others and loses its appeal as we learn more about the true secrets of the fractions and how ridiculous it is. The plot become slow and tedious to read. It seems like much of the plot wasn't completely thought out by the author--- why didn't the people living in the Fractions ever notice the planes flying above them? When they inserted Tris's mom into the experiment, they said they only reset a few people. They would need to have reset A LOT of people and being reset is supposed to change their personality-- wouldn't that be noticed by friends in the Fractions. Nothing made sense. And why didn't they try to come up with a better idea than a suicide mission? Seriously, they had other options. I could see other options and I'm just a reader. The only thing consistent is the failure after failure after failure in the plot line.And really, how many times can Tris and Tobias get shot? I actually began to roll my eyes at their many, many flesh wounds while everyone else keeps dying in various ways and many without reason. Although, I don't even understand why Uriah or Tori had to die. It was pointless and just caused more useless conflict between Tris and Tobias that annoyed the *bleep* out of me and continued to make both the main characters act outside of their normal behavior. Half way through this book I wanted to stop reading it. I wish I did.Oh, and then end is horrible. No, beyond horrible. Deplorable. The worst ending of any book and it's not because I don't like what happened-- sometimes endings should be sad. It's because of how she wrote it. You don't do what she did without making a major point and showing that there was no other way. But there were other ways. There were other options. Her ending was useless and pointless and a disrespect to the other two books and the characters.SPOILERSo we expect that Tris is somehow super human and immune to the death serum which she is (shocker), but you don't expect the dude in the wheelchair with two bum legs to kill her. Yeah, the gimp kills the girl who always beats the crap out of everyone else. Why can't she figure out a way to get the gun from him and THEN go push some buttons? He's in a wheelchair. Come on! He didn't deserve to kill her.Was her death necessary to the story? No. Does it make the story better? No. Did it serve a purpose? No.So why'd she die? Maybe to make the story memorable? Well, then Roth succeeded in making this the book that I'll remember as being one of the worst book I've read. Good job. I applaud you.AND since Tris's death was to save the city she loves by reprograming the government-- would it work in the long term? Sure it might have stopped the attack within 48 hours, but what about in a week? A month? What about all the other compounds and leaders who they interact with? They will notice the newly reset government and their sudden lack of knowledge about divergents and the defective genes. Wouldn't you think that they'd notice something was off and then shut down the program anyways? Just reset that entire compound including all of Tris's friends or kill them as traitors?What about those horrible soldiers that terrorized the people in the ghetto? Did her death stop them? No. They had no affiliation with their compound so obviously there are more government programs close by. Don't you think they'll notice when one compound starts behaving differently than every other person in the region and in the world? So her death would have been in vain anyways if the book was to make any logical sense.To be honest, I didn't read the last 10 pages or so after Tris was confirmed dead. Maybe those last 10 pages were really, really good. I don't think so.What did her death do? Spare her traitor brother (giving him salvation and probably survivor's guilt) and devastate her friends and lover. Did it serve a purpose that could not have been accomplished by another means? No.Who does that?! Who kills a main character for no good reason?!Roth just pissed me off and made me regret reading the entire series.

{"reviewTime": "02 16, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "First of all, there will be spoilers....I'm kind of on the fence as far as how I feel about this book. On the one hand, I loved it. I felt the story was good, although basically being a close copy of the Game Cube game Custom Robo (I wonder if anyone else felt that way). There are some differences, sure, but it's reasonably similar. On the flip side of that, this story had some gaping plot holes and had a lot of things that were very poorly thought out.Pros:Got to see what was outside the fenceMore information about Tris' momDelved deeper into Peter's mindsetetcThere are a fair few other reasons why I liked this book, though I don't care to list them all. The part about Peter was interesting: I liked that it showed him showing remorse and disgust for himself, it went further into how he was shown in Insurgent a bit. It led to him going so far as to fight Four for the sake of getting his mind wiped to change himself, something he admitted he wouldn't be able to do on his own. Alright, I can live with that. Actually, I can understand... It's very hard to change yourself, even more so without people around you constantly helping you, something I can relate to. Sure, he took the cheap way out, but it was a legitimate reason that I felt worked.Cons:Some died unnecessarilyCharacters behaved unlike themselvesThe ending was lackingetc.Now, when I say people died unnecessarily, I mean it. Have you ever read the Harry Potter series? How Mad-Eye dies more or less unnecessarily at the start of the 7th book? Yeah, that's how this one goes, except it is Tori that dies. I can buy that they'd get attacked, but she dies too easily for being someone that'd been that important in the first 2 books (a Dauntless leader, one of Tris' closest confidants). Then there's Uriah. He was another key character from the beginning as he was the one that got Tris involved with the pure Dauntless, those that were born there, and was also the one that always provided the much needed comic relief. What was his reason for dying? To provide Tris with fuel for her &#34;Listen to me, I'm usually right!&#34; fire and Four with major guilt at causing one of his best friends' brother to die. But the full negativity lies in how Tris dies.Let me start by saying I have no issues with her dying... I've got no problem when a main character dies so long as it serves a purpose and is well done. In this case, however, it wasn't. She gets shot trying to finish a mission rather than attacking the person holding her at gunpoint. Come on, this is Tris we're talking about... She's a smart chick even if she does let her emotions get the best of her sometime. Sure, the book doesn't give exact details as to how far David is from her when she enters the lab, or details as to the exact layout of the area, but what are the odds that this Dauntless legend, the only chick to be involved in almost every conflict since the story began, would have just dove at the memory serum to complete the mission without first figuring out how to increase her chances of success? If David would have shot her in the head on her run over toward the serum it'd have been over without her ever finishing it, end of story. Are we readers really expected to believe that she wouldn't have first thought about how to put some cover between the two of them or, better yet, tried to discern a way to get the gun from him without getting killed? Sure, she'd have likely been hit once or twice, but she'd have had a much higher chance of survival and Tris has long given up her reckless death seeking. She went into the death serum willingly, sure, but she had a point: she did have a chance at fighting it off as she was the only one known that could throw off every serum other than the highly concentrated fear serum.The death of Tris serves no purpose other than to give Four a reason to go zip lining for his first time and make him reconsider himself as he almost drinks memory serum to wipe his mind clean of all that happened. This is pathetic.Despite all the plot holes, the way the conflict in the city is resolved, and the pointless killing, part of me really likes this book. There was a certain draw to it that I'm not sure how to explain.

{"reviewTime": "11 5, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Short Non Spoiler Review:Fast paced, action filled (towards the end), answer fulfilling book.  You will be nervous, you will be mad, you will be devastated.  Prepare yourself. Still read it.Long Spoilerful (I realize this isn't a word) Review:What to the what just happened.  My heart is broken.  I am devastated.  I feel empty.  Why Veronica WHYYY?!?! *Tears and ugly sobbing*Ok so that was what was going through my mind upon finishing Allegiant.  Having been able to think it over for a little while I get why Veronica killed Tris.  Well I get what makes sense to me, whether it's what Veronica was going for I don't know.  It's a dystopian book, things are dark.  It's not a fairytale and although we wish for happily ever after we don't always get it.  Veronica kept it real by killing off Tris, she showed us that sometimes in order to get to the good you have to go through the bad.  I'm not happy Tris died and I can think of all sorts of ways things could have gone so she wouldn't have had to, but its not my story.  Moving on.Up until the end I was very pleased with how the book was going.  It really answered a lot of questions.  In fact the book was mostly informational compared to the action packed Divergent and Insurgent books. It was also different from the first two books because the story was being told from both Tris and Tobias' POVs.  (That should have served as a warning really)  I didn't think I would like it, mostly because I don't go for books told from a male POV, but in my opinion it was nicely done.  Others seem to think the POVs were too similar too each other, basically that Tobias seemed a little feminine, maybe that's why I was ok with it.I was angry with Tris and Tobias pretty much the whole book, ok I was angry mostly at Tobias, for letting their relationship fall apart.  I hated Tobias for not trusting Tris and for making dumb decisions.  Of course he eventually smartens up and the make up (and more possibly).  I think that helps to make me more sad about Tris' death.  They had just gotten back to good and were looking forward to planning their lives together then BAM it gets taken away from them.Overall I don't regret reading this series.  Divergent was my first dystopian book and really is what turned me on to the genre.  That being said, Allegiant really makes me think twice about reading another dystopian.  It really opened my eyes to the fact that authors really hold the power to break your heart and that there is no rule stating they have to make a book end happily.  Looking back I wish I would have waited a little longer to read Allegiant, just so it would have prolonged the sadness.I fell in love with him.  But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me.  I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other.

I liked and didn't like this.  I didn't think that Four's voice was distinct enough and I sometimes had to really think about whose perspective I was reading from.Okay, so, I was not crazy about this book as a whole.  At least, not nearly as crazy as I was for Divergent and Insurgent!  I took issue with a lot of things and, honestly, I just wasn't captivated by it.  I didn't feel a very strong connection to the characters, which was strange considering how much I loved them in the previous books.  And I even re-read the first two books right before Allegiant so that I wouldn't lose that connection (or in order to refresh my connection).  But, I just wasn't feelin' it in this one.I found Tris and Four's relationship as being very dysfunctional in this book.  I mean, I suppose it started in Insurgent.  But, it was even worse in Allegiant.  They seemed to think they could solve everything by just making out rather than actually talking about it.  Every time they started to have a meaningful conversation and I thought things were actually going to be resolved, they would just start kissing instead!  No wonder they have so many issues.  These are not the keys to a successful relationship!  They also didn't seem to have much respect for each other.

It takes truly understanding your bravery in order to be self-sacrificial. So she did.And to me, the ending was a bit like Romeo and Juliet. It took a death (not two, thankfully) to truly get the change needed in the city and the country. The difference? Romeo and Juliet is about 25,000 words long. The Divergent trilogy is closer to 500,000 words. So I think we care more. A bit more invested in the characters.There are truly bits that I found confusing. There were some plot holes.

US FANS, were absolutely just DYING for this. Over one year we had to wait for Allegiant, only to be delivered something just entirely off what we were expecting/wanting. What have we ever done to you to deserve this kind of ending?You know, it started off alright. Very Divergent-ish kind of start. Started in a way that made me feel: \"everything is gonna be okay!\". Everything was even alright until say like the very, very end. Like last 50 pages.BOOSH. That was how the world went after that lovely bomb of an ending. Thank you so very much Veronica Roth. Honestly, how am I supposed to even watch the movie next March now? I was looking forward to it so much!You might have noticed I'm not mentioning the beginning or middle of Allegiant. Well, you can expect Divergent level writing, lots of suspense, and lots of stupidity amongst our characters. But yeah, as I said, everything just seems a lot more bearable compared to the ending. If V ended it better, this book would have garnered a five stars. You know what I can compare this to? Requiem. Everyone remembers the ending to the Delirium series by Lauren Oliver right? We were all just like \"WHA--WHA--HUH???\".Yes. Expect something inspirational at the end of Allegiant. Don't be expecting a perfect happy ending. Prepare yourself for disappointment and angry tears.My first reaction to this was to just sob.The second reaction was acceptance.The third reaction was reevaluating reaction number two. Reaction turns into the utmost anger. I finished Allegiant the day it came out. There's a reason this \"review\" hasn't come out until now. I just didn't even know what to think after it. Mind = Blown.I'm sure lots of people will be really terrified to read Allegiant after this rant, but I do want to give you a little bit of assurance. I'm sure some people will be perfectly content with the ending to Allegiant, and might even praise V for having the, ahem \"BRAVERY\", to end the series in such a way. She sure did have guts, I mean, I'm sure some diehard fan is going to be showing up at her front door with a stack of complaints. That is why I'm giving this 3 stars.

I was sad cause the series was over and I would not have something more to look up too of the great series of Divergent. I know that there will be the Four series, but It's not the same thing. Tris won't be there...This was quite a ride that made me feel ups and downs and I think that this book was only one that could make me see the world as a diffrent thing. (ok not the only one, but one of the only ones). I can now see the Abnegation in people like my friends and I take it in and apreciate that this person has a great quality that she made of her own. Not by this crazy experiment that makes people genitecly damaged. I see the Erudite in people that pay attention in class and are happy to study somethings they love or talk about books with me. I see the Amity in people by seeing them sing and enjoy life in the momment and be HAPPY!! That is a wonderful feeling you know.. I see the Candor in people that are honest and true. Sometimes those are some good people, but don't be too close to that person :P But last and not least, I see Dauntless in the most brave and cruel people. I see them fight for what they want and achieve there challenges and won't take a chance to face there fears and do the job. I'm glad that I see myself a bit in every piece of the factions since I've started the book. Now, the book has made me anticipate to be BRAVE and face my fears and stop being a coward, to be WISE in my decisions and stay good at school and continue reading good books like these, to be PEACEFUL without starting a fight for nothing with good people and to care about the environment and just be happy, to be SELFLESS and help people in need and to stop thinking of myself and say &#34;Hey! Look around, theres other people in the world then yourself&#34;, (the books made me realize that I was more selfish then I taught), and to be TRUTHFUL and HONEST to the people around me and say what I need to say and don't be afraid of saying the wrong thing, the people will finish by understanding and forgiving. So YES! I loved this series and this book and It will always be one of my favorite series that will enter my everyday life and that I will be proud of showing.Ok, first of all can I give a round of applause for all those courageous people in this book! LIKE WOW!!! Ok like 15 people died... I want to make a memorial of them. so Rest in Peace: Edit Prior, Bobby, Albert, Will, Nathalie Prior, Andrew Prior, Edward, Eric(even that sun of a bitch), Marlene, Fernando, Jeanine Matthews, Lynn, Tori, Uriah, and finally and most of all, Tris. I loved most of these character and I'm really sad that they died, some of them really did not deserve it! I really loved to read about all of these and I'm going to miss them.OK. I have seen the Divergent movie and I cried, A LOT! First of all, I arrive in the cinema and there is just The fault in Our Stars trailer that is playing, of course, I cried, I was too emotional about the movie! Both of them! Then the movie starts and I get all excited!!! It was soooooo good! Ok so then there is just Tris that goes on that train and I cried a lot in there cause I know that that is where everything mostly started, like when she became Dauntless and it was just too beautiful. Every time I saw Tris, I was just reminded of the ending of Allegiant. It was HORRIBLE!! I was just thinking of the Gunshot and it just made me sad. I really loved the movie by the way! It was one of the best book-to-movie adaptations I have ever seen! WOW!! They did everything so good! I think that they even nailed it better than the Hunger Games. It was really Perfect. There was just a few scenes that they did not put, but it's not that bad ;) Ok, the other part that I cried, and I have cried the most threw out the whole movie was the Zip line. Ok, did anybody else cry at that part?? I was just reminded of the way she was thinking about the feeling of it in the book, and then of Four that let's of all her ashes in the sky during the zip line. Look I'm crying now just thinking about it ;'( It was just so beautifully filmed and I'm so proud of it! It's just so emotional and we are doing it with her the whole time, I could just feel it! Then there was just the perfect ending in the train with Four and Tris just cuddling there and it was just so cut and I knew the movie was over so I just cried again ;P I got to say that that director (I think it's Neil Burger or something like that that has Burger for the last name :P) is one of the best ones! He really did a perfect job!So all I really got to say about the book is that it was seriously Perfect! Jut the way it is! I'm really sad that this series is over. I want more of it! Like I really loved it from the beginning till the ending! I loved the idea about the genetics! So intelligent, why did I not taught of that ;P I don't like that Four was all mad about being genetically damaged and stuff cause that made Tris and him a bit apart. I would feel really guilty if I was him, cause it was sort of his fault that Uriah is dead. I loved Uriah! I taught that he would have been really good for Christina. I loved that we could read from Tobias's perception! It was so interesting! I like to see what he's thinking! But I really like the way that it ends. I'm sad for Tris, but it was well done. The most emotional part was really when Four went to do the zip line to let her ashes go free. I can't wait to see that on film. I WILL CRY A LOT' AGAIN!

I was not on a roller coaster with the character, but with the author. I did not feel like her descriptions of Tris, the main character,  embodies the torment and angst of a post apocalyptic teenager, except for some parts of her love story. I did loved how in this future there was an equalization of the sexes. Unfortunately she went too far in this last book and ended up verbally castrating her male lead.

{"reviewTime": "10 30, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Warning this review is going to be honest, extremely emotional, and a wee bit long.  There will also be spoilers from Divergent and Insurgent.  Any spoilers for Allegiant will be put in spoiler section.The Divergent series means a lot to me.  It's something that holds a special place deep within me.  In fact, I fear I may start crying while writing this review because just thinking about it gets me really emotional.  I've also had the pleasure of meeting the author Veronica Roth on a few occastions.  I first read Divergent about a month after it's release back in June 2011.  It's the first series that I pretty much have been following since it's initial publication.  I think that's one of the reasons why I feel so protective of it.  I've never really been a part of the beginning of a fandom.  It's been amazing watching the Divergent community grow and grow.Allegiant picks up right where Insurgent left off.  I feel that this series is one book divided into three parts because of this.  The beginning of each book picks right up where the last book ended.  This is something that I actually really like, even though it can make it a bit confusing if it's been awhile since you've read them.  Which is what happened to me when I read Insurgent.  So before Allegiant came out, I did a re read of both Divergent and Insurgent.  And I was pleased to find out that there were certain hints dropped as early as the first book that there could be something outside of the fence.  In chapter eleven when Tris sees a Dauntless guard closing the gate, she notices that the lock is on the outside.  And then she narrates, \"Why would they lock the gate from the outside and not the inside?  It almost seems like they don't want to keep something out; they want to keep us in.\"  I love it when authors foreshadow, especially when it goes right over your head the first time you read it!After having a slight panic at midnight on the book's release date, when the book didn't download onto my Kindle at exactly midnight, I started reading.  I read the first few chapters, and then went to bed.  I woke up the next morning and checked the reviews online.  They were mostly negative.  But I tried to not let it affect me.  From what I had gathered from the glimpses of the reviews I read was that they didn't like the ending.  People who don't like an ending can let that affect their overall feelings for a book series.  And I get it.  It's amazing to feel so close to characters.  To worry about their fate.  Great but fearful.  Because of this while reading Allegiant I kept trying to predict what would happen and imagined the worse case scenarios.  Even though I just wanted to read, I just couldn't.  I love this world.  I feel connected it to it.  But then I realized that by letting others opinions cloud my judgement, it was affecting my enjoyment of the book.  And I want to make it clear, I enjoyed it.  I loved this book.As readers we got to see a glance at what goes through Tobias's head with the short novella \"Free Four.\"  But Allegiant is told from a dual point of view.  From Tris and Tobias's point of view.  Fortunately for me, dual point of views don't bother me because I've read many stories and books from different character perspectives.  Also by the end of the first book Divergent, the story really started to warp from being just Tris's story, to Tris and Tobias's story.  Yes, it probably will be weird for some to read the dual point of views, and there were a few times in which I forgot whose point of view I was reading from.  But overall it really does work.Some of my favorite scenes from Allegiant were the scenes between Tris and Tobias.  They are just so well written.  I smile just thinking about them.  They are just a beautiful couple.  But at the same time I liked the scenes between Tris and her brother Caleb.  I didn't see Caleb's betrayal coming in Insurgent.  Veronica Roth has said that Caleb is neither good nor bad.  And I definitely got this vibe from him.  To see Tris struggle with whether or not she could forgive him showed us a different side of her.  I am so used to the Tris that told Al, that he disgusted her and called him a coward.  I always gathered that once Tris had an opinion of you, it was permanent.  It was nice to see her see it through a shade of gray.Family issues was a pretty big focus through out the novel, because Tobias struggled with his mother Evelyn.  I hated Evelyn in Insurgent.  And I figured out that the only reason why I didn't like her was because she didn't like Tris.  But Evelyn is really strong.  And a lot of her decisions branch from her being in an abusive relationship and pretty much starving the past few years.  I am glad that we got to see her from Tobias's point of view because his feelings for her are definitely different than Tris's.Friendship is another factor.  Before I started Allegiant, I was surprised at how few characters from the beginning of the series were still alive after Insurgent.  We'd started off with so many, and slowly characters were being picked off.  I am glad that Tris has Christina.  I was proud of Christina in Insurgent, when she forgave Tris for killing Will.  Their friendship is a perfect example of a great adolescent friendship.  Great character development has always been a strong point in this series.The main plot of Allegiant involves the characters going outside of the fence.  And my heart was pounding as they journeyed to parts unknown.  I was just as curious as they were to what awaited them.  But I also chuckled at their naivety to certain things such as an airplane and \"Coca-Cola\". New characters were introduced and a few new things which included scientific terms like genetics.  Now normally science can confuse me, it wasn't one of my strongest subjects in school, but it's explained in a way that it's easy to understand.  Because of this I was able to breeze right through the plot with no problems.I've invested so much with these characters and because I've had so much time in between each book, they've been in my head for so long.  That I've imagined scenarios with them in my head.  This is a first for me.  And it makes it difficult to remember that these are not my characters.  And that the situations that I created are not a reality.  And I believe that this is one of the factors of why there are such negative reviews for Allegiant.  When you fall in love with a series, you want a happily ever after.  We grow up with Disney movies and fairy tales, that tell us that even if things are really bad in the end everything will work out just fine.  We forget that we are not the author of the books that we love.  And even though authors love and appreciate reader feedback, in the end they decide our beloved characters fates.  Divergent isn't a fairytale.*The next few paragraphs will be me discussing the ending of Allegiant.  Lots of spoilers ahead.*Tris's death was really touching for me. I cried, but I was smiling at the same time. I've never read a book with an ending like that. I think in the end Tris was brave. She also wasn't sane. And she didn't want to die in vain. When she decided to take Caleb's place to stop the memory serum from being released, I was so proud of her. To see her make her final journey, to commit her final act, was just so emotional. And I don't think all readers got that. Most are just so concerned on the fact that she was killed. You have to really examine the situation before you make a final judgement. Most of the reviews I have read are being written in the heat of the moment, and are just initial thoughts and feelings. That's why I purposely waited a few days before I finished writing my review. If Caleb had gone, she wouldn't have been able to forgive herself. And she probably wouldn't have been the same. I don't think Tobias would have been enough. One person can't save you completely. They can help, but I am tired of books where being in love is the end all of everything. Tobias's reaction to her death was so moving. And to see Tobias cry, was so important. I actually felt like he was Tobias in that moment, not Four.Evelyn choosing Tobias over revenge was also touching. They both chose to be mother and son. During the epilogue, reading their changed relationship just made me smile. And Tobias as a politician? He's definitely got my vote! Tobias has grown so much. The final scene with him going down the zip line of the Hancock building to spread Tris's ashes really chokes me up. It's so beautiful. Him facing his fears to love and honor her memory by doing something that she loved is brave. It's captured so perfectly on paper, that I can visualize it really well.Is this the ending that I would have wanted for Tris and Tobias? Of course not. If I had my way, the epilogue would be Tris and Tobias living in a cottage, with 3 kids and another on the way. And that is probably a similar ending that most Divergent fans wanted.*end spoiler*Young adult author John Green always says that, \"books belong to their readers.\"  And yes this is true, but it is still the author's story.  And the author's job is to tell a story from beginning, middle, and end.  I believe Veronica Roth has done this.  She wrote a touching and moving dystopian trilogy, that I hope I am still sharing with others for years to come.If I could summarize a message that I got from the Divergent trilogy it would be, \"Face your fears and be brave.\"  Even though I am close to 30, I've learned so much about myself from reading this series.  At times I find myself chanting in my head, \"Be dauntless!\"  when I am in a uncomfortable situation.  And I think that's the reason why I've wanted people to read this series.  It teaches you to fight, to not give up.  I truly wish this series was around when I was in my teens.  Tris would have been an awesome role model. If I could give Tris a message it would be this, \"You did well Tris!  You did really well!\"Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fiction", "reviewerName": "Step Into Fiction", "summary": "Bold and solid ending to a fantastic dystopian trilogy!", "helpful": [13, 24], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383091200, "reviewerID": "A2LNHLLIDZLZ21"}

{"reviewTime": "10 31, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "After waiting a year and a half Allegiant has finally came out!! I really did like this book for many different reasons while some scenes I did not like. Veronica Roth has amazed me with her writing since the beginning with Divergent (one of my favorite books). I am sad to  see this series grow because I got so connected with the characters and the action. Tris and Four are characters that I will forever re-read over and over again. Veronica's writing was intense and full of suspense as we got to see the operations of the fractions. I never read any of the spoilers so I went into Allegiant head first and discovered why I did love this series.It picks up right after Insurgent, after discovering who is Edith Prior is in the video. Allegaint really opens up more about the history of the fractions as well as the Allegiant's. While I was about to cry through some parts of the book it did start off slow to me. Allegiant showed us the people beyond the wall. Like the other books there are many sacrifices the characters go through to get to the end. Veronica Roth did a great job representing who Tris really is and her discovering who she really is. After reading on Veronica's site about the ending I felt it does fit the book perfectly. While others can be mad about the book remember that it remains true to the characters and what they did in every book.Tobia's character point of view really changes throughout the book. I felt that Roth made Tobia's more of a depressing character the entire novel. I did like his views because we got to see a different part of him and his fears through his eyes. He was more distant with Tris at times but it was more understandable once you read  Allegiant. The plot about the outside world beyond Chicago was really interesting because we learned more about Tris' mom and how she came to Dauntless etc.Overall the book was a good read, and it still has me thinking about the book to this day. There is so many questions that I would love to get answered but Veronica successfully did that with this book. It had a good ending that made me feel like crying and satisfied with what happened. I look forward to many other peoples reactions and thoughts after reading this final book in the Divergent series, but the first book will always be my favorite.

{"reviewTime": "11 1, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I've decided to give Allegiant 3.5 stars, but can't give more than that. I just read on Veronica's website the reason why she decided to do what she did, but I don't agree with her choice to do that at the end of this story, and I am disappointed that she felt she had to. Now to what I liked and did not like about Allegiant, the 3rd and final book about Tris, Four and the Factions that began with a bang in Divergent. I absolutely loved Divergent. It was so different, unique and mysterious. Insurgent, the 2nd in the trilogy was good too, building up to what the factions are all about, and what is really outside of Chicago's walls.Allegiant started out rather slowly. After learning about the &#34;Allegiant&#34;, who they are and what they stand for; Tris, Tobias, Christina, and even Caleb (and others) get to leave the city, and the group learns what the factions are all about. Once they are installed and living (temporarily?) in the Bureau building, while learning about their actual reality (and I'm not going to go into detail so as not to spoil anyone), what being &#34;Divergent&#34; actually means, the story takes a drag. It seemed like Roth was continuously beating us over our heads with the correlation between the difference in the Divergent (genetically pure or GP) and the GD (genetically damaged) and how that compares to our own society between the &#34;haves&#34; and &#34;have nots&#34;. I get it, I get it,, I don't need 100+ pages explaining that to me over and over again.Roth also tells this book from alternating POV's between Tris and Tobias. However, their voices were too close to each other, it was sometimes difficult to remember who was speaking and I'd have to go back to the beginning of the chapter sometimes to figure out who's head I was in. She should have just reserved her alternate POV's for the very end - I think she would have had even stronger shock value then anyway.However, once we get past Roth's ramblings about the fact that the GP are superior than the GD and that we need to start some type of revolution, yeah, once that was done, the story picked up and got very exciting. I was on the edge of my seat.. what will Tris do? What will Tobias do? Will they make decisions that affect each other? Will they stay together? What plan of action will they all decide to take?Tris is known for rushing into things, not thinking them through completely and putting herself in tough positions (like almost getting killed several times). I think she really starts to think about who she is and what she wants out of life, once she realizes where she (and her mother) actually come from and why she makes the choices that she makes. Tobias, on the other hand makes some really stupid decisions that keep him out of Tris's favor for a good part of the middle section, and Tobias does have some beautiful lines though.&#34;Her eyes drift to mine, and her stare carves me into a smaller man.&#34; -Tobias&#34;Sometimes I still forget to look for the gentler parts of her.

Again, as I stated earlier, I am disappointed in Ms. Roth, and think she should have made a different (and I feel better) decision.

Everything I loved about Tobias in Divergent shriveled away in book three. This powerful Dauntless instructor who was the epitome of strength and compassion nosedived into a pawn of three much stronger women (Evelyn, Nita, and Tris). Who can get into that? I have always believed that good stories should end while they still have impact. Sequels are usually never as good as the original story, which the author probably worked on for many years. Forcing second and third books out within a year of each other does not allow the author the time to develop the story. While I understand that fans are waiting, I'd rather wait a little longer and be satisfied in the end.

There had been so much action before, culminating in Tris's almost execution; I was glued to the pages while reading the first two books, and was so looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it's not a particularly thrilling ending to a great series.Don't get me wrong; there are parts to Allegiant that are good, and even clever. I liked the back story given for Tris's mother; it made sense and gave new layers to what happened. There's some action, and it's generally well-written. The character development is solid, if irritating; there's way too much over-thinking and not enough just going with the flow of emotion. However, Allegiant is overly padded with loooooong segments of talking about what might be going on, what is going on, what will be going on, and almost all of it has to do with genetic damage. I have to admit that my eyes began to glaze on the topic after a while because really...who cares? I never did understand who started damaging the genes to begin with, and how the &#34;repair&#34; was taking place. All of it seemed so secondary to the characters and yet it was the main focus of the story. Meanwhile, things are going down back in Chicago that must be rectified immediately and yet it seems as though there's ambivalence about it.My biggest issue with Allegiant, after the overly long segments wherein little seems to happen other than Tris and Tobias fighting and talk of genetic damage, is the dual points of view. I understand why we needed them, but I swear a chapter would change, and with it the point of view, and I would not notice. I'd actually read a few pages into the next chapter before I'd think, &#34;Oh, this is Tris talking now&#34;.  It's not good when your characters are so inter-changeable, and not in a good way. The voices were the same, and neither offered much in the way of excitement.I know a lot of people are upset over the BIG twist, and rightfully so; I do feel let down by how Roth chose to end her story. It just seemed pointless, even if it was in character for the most part. I think I could have lived with it had I felt it was a necessary sacrifice to the overall story but it just felt wrong on so many levels.

I heard that this ending was going to be \"shocking\" and so have been avoiding GoodReads, Pinterest, and my other reader Facebook friends all week so nothing would be ruined for me and it wasn't. Maybe expecting \"shocking\" enough was enough to ruin things for me though, because I did predict what would happen, I just really hoped I would be wrong.I feel robbed. This book was not anything what I had been expecting and anticipating. Compared to the exhilaration of just sitting reading Divergent and Insurgent, this book was boring. Tris and Four find themselves out of one rebellion and into another. There is a lot of explanation for all the plot holes in the first two books, so many that parts of the book begin to feel like a lecture. It's not until the last segment of the book that the pacing picks up and begins to even approach the intensity levels of the previous books. Not only was the book boring, but I felt like all of the things I liked about the first two books were taken away from me. Understanding that the books were originally designed to be written from Tobias's point of view makes it a little easier to understand why they ended the way they did but I still don't get it. I don't get why the shock effect was more important than the messages that were so strongly promoted in Insurgent.Don't get me wrong, I still love the series and can't wait to re-read them. I love Tris, Four, Uriah, Christina, and all of the characters and the complexity of their relationships. I love the grittiness and dark-side of the story. None of the characters in this series have it easy. They survive and then they deal with things- there's no glossing over the violence or pain just because it's a popular young adult book. Most of all, I love how these books investigate the flaws in our own society and leave readers mind's reeling.

Roth initial capitalizes on this well, with a semi-funny glimpse into our world through our characters eyes. And of course the origins and explanations for the whole premise (which I will not spoil here) which do not disappoint.What does disappoint is the lack of developing the new setting. Obviously there are going to be some new challenges, but one feels like Tris, Fourbias, and co are still in the sterile environs of Faction-city. While there are new themes and ideas of memory manipulation (and misuse) this doesn't gel well with the over-arching plot.Finally the story simply lacks genuine tension. Ok sure there is action, violence and  some form of teen angst and discovery, but ultimately one feels like this book is just a tired action movie with plot thrown in to try and justify its existence.A quick word on the ending - it seems to be that Roth has attempted to shock, or be hard-hitting and 'real-world' with the finale. My thoughts are that when the majority of the content of a story doesn't sit right a gutsy ending feels expedient and attention-seeking rather than genuine.In short, if you've read the prequels to this then obviously you're going to pick this book up, but perhaps by lowering expectation one may still enjoy it OR fair warning.", "reviewerName": "T.

However, a lot of the events in Divergent and Insurgent shape what happens in Allegiant so there will be minor spoilers for the first two books in the series, but nothing that would completely ruin your enjoyment of reading those two.I&#8217;m just going to get right to what everyone is talking about&#8230; the ending. I won&#8217;t say much, because again spoilers, but it&#8217;s a shocker. It&#8217;s not your typical ending and yes it did make me ugly cry, but it&#8217;s also not a bad ending, which is contrary to what most people are saying. It&#8217;s different and shocking and brave. Honestly, I don&#8217;t understand all the backlash. People constantly complain about how YA books all follow the same path and nothing is new, but then when something comes along that is new, they rise up against it.Veronica Roth&#8217;s writing is still wonderful and she easily pulls the reader into this world. Any writer that can take your heart and practically fuse it to the characters and their well-being is truly something special and that is exactly what she did. The story was engaging and kept me on edge and I loved every single second of it, even the seconds that hurt.My absolute favorite part of the story was getting inside Four&#8217;s head. I really enjoyed reading from his perspective. I felt like it really added another layer to the story. We also see just how damaged he is. Four is not as strong as we were once led to believe and Marcus did more damage to him than we thought. Getting inside his head really enabled you to understand why he does the things he does and why he makes the decisions he makes. Plus, I just love him, so it was nice reading more about him.Tris will always be one of my favorite heroines. She is so strong and willing to do whatever is necessary. I love her strength and compassion. I love that she is real and breaks down. I love her ability to forgive anyone and how she loves completely. I also love that she and Four bring out the best in each other and make one another better.A lot of people have a lot of hate towards this book, but I don&#8217;t get it. Yes everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I really thought it was a good book. It may not have been exactly what I wanted but it was still good and was still enjoyable. The writing is fantastic and the world created is so amazing. This book changes everything you thought you knew about the series. It wraps everything up and that for me is the most important thing in a conclusion&#8230; no loose ends.All in all, Allegiant is a good read. This series will always be one of my very favorites.

And no, I am not talking about the ending, which I know a lot of people loathed because I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s the author&#8217;s obligation to make readers happy. You don&#8217;t own Tris and Four, dudes. Veronica does and she&#8217;s free to do whatever she wants with them.The thing I am most disappointed about were the character voices. Four and Tris weren&#8217;t different enough in their POVs to make them distinguishable from each other. Change the pronouns used and the two of them were interchangeable. I don&#8217;t even get why Veronica wrote Allegiant with a dual POV since the same events happened, told in similar voices that the dual perspectives were frankly, unnecessary. It would have been much better had it been told from Tris&#8217; point of view. She was a really strong character in Allegiant whereas Four sounded like a dude on menopause. I loved Four in the previous books in the series but that dual POVs was a huge mistake as it made me despise him a little bit.Allegiant was also very slow paced with no substantial action. Divergent was so action-packed, Insurgent was kind of meh but Allegiant was downright boring. It lacked the development, finesse, believable dialogue and action that Divergent boasted of. It was 95% cheesy dialogue and make-out sessions with sporadic intervals of shoo going guns and serums. The story focused too much on the relationship aspect instead of the actual pinnacle of the war. Allegiant&#8216;s main plot line was anti-climatic and nonsensical since the world inside was no different from the world outside. There was still discrimination; factionless and factioned people of the inside and the genetically damaged and genetically whole people of the outside. IT WAS SO FRIGGING FRUSTRATING!With that cliffhanger that concluded Insurgent, I expected much more from Allegiant. All I got was a Biology textbook &#8211; I mean, come on!

I have waited an entire week to share my thoughts, and I still can't come to terms with what I feel. I am beyond words.Veronica Roth took this series to a place I never expected. I admire her brazen decision, but it has left a hole. A deep, everlasting hole. When I read that fateful scene, I could not believe it. I read it, then I reread it because I just knew I was missing something. But then that `something' never came.Am I satisfied? Heck no! I wanted it to be anyone else but her. I didn't even feel complete knowing Tobias was still hanging around.What did I want? I have no idea. All I know is it wasn't what I got! I just can't... ack... ugh*** END SPOILER ALERT**The other thing that really got to me this time around was Tobias. I have enjoyed him so much over the years, but this time he just did not sit well with me. He constantly doubted Tris, and he came across whiny. I can say that having these HUGE character flaws did make the characters so much more believable. So that was a plus.I also didn't mind the alternating points of view. I was pretty excited to see Tobias's side of things. However, by the end, I found him to get on my nerves a bit. I now feel that Veronica Roth's strength is writing strong female leads. I never found myself having a 100% buy in with Tobias.My final rant is the spin the final book took. We finally got to see the full outcome of this dystopian setting. It made sense, and I guess it worked, but... It didn't wow me like I thought it would. Oh, let me also go ahead and say how awful the beginning was. It started right where Insurgent ended, but I was so confused! It's been a year since I read that book. I need some kind of fill in to catch me up on things. Do you know how many books I read in a year?! These plots get muddled, and I do not want to have to reread a book just to make sense of the sequel.

Why did Roth need all the angst in the middle if her only goals were to  simply introduce some weird genetic engineering background to the story and then \"shock\" us at the ned?Look, I realise authors have control over their stories, and readers don't get to  decide how a story ends. And I realise this book will sell like hot cakes even if it's terrible. But since I'm still coping with this utter disappointment this novel brings, have a quick (spoiler-free) rundown of what's wrong with this book.1. Gigantic info dump that occurs and immediately changes the mood of entire book.2. Deus ex machinas abound. Even if I weren't trying to be spoiler-free, there would be too many to list.3. Characters are so badly characterised. Did everyone just get mutiple personality disorder between Insurgent and Allegiant?4. Slowwwwww pacing, made worse by aforementioned 526 pages. It's even worse because we've already gotten used to the forms of fighting in Roth's world and the action becomes repetitive.5. Abrupt ending that felt that Roth put no effort into it. I was happy that it finally ended, because I cared about the story less and less.6. The two perspectives sound the same. At times when I had to do something and put the book down in the middle of a chapter, when I came back I couldn't even tell who was narrating. And what was the point about narrating from Four's perspective anyways?7. Strangely, even with the addition of Tobias's perspective, there was far too much romance in what was supposed to be a grand finale to the series. And let's just say it was described awkwardly as well.8. So many plot holes, not just in the ending, but in the world itself. Yes, I realise this is a literally broken world. However, it did not feel like a realistic broken world. The technology felt anachronistic at times, for one.In essence, if you've read the previous  two, you'll still probably read this (I myself usually finish trilogies), but I  sincerely hope you set your expectations low, because they won't be exceeded by Roth anytime soon.

{"reviewTime": "10 25, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "One choice can--and will-- change everything. In the conclusion of the Divergent series, the place that Tris, Tobias, and the rest of their people have called home for decades is now keeping them prisoner, locked away from the outside world that the Divergent are apparently supposed to save. Kept from the truth for so long, Tris and her friends are determined to discover what is really out there, and what their purpose is. But the truth is bigger than they realize, and they must decide what they are going to do with the dangerous and life changing information given to them. With pain, loss, heartbreak, and sacrifice clogging their past and present, who will they trust and what truth will they believe to help them journey into their future?Allegiant possesses many positive qualities that are very similar to the previous two books: tension between people groups that have differing views of how their city should operate, relationship issues and improvements between Tris and Tobias, and personnel journeys that each character goes through just to name a few. The growth of the characters are wonderful, and Roth does a great job of not making \"perfect\" characters, but ones that have flaws and issues and must discover what they are and how to work through them.Although this book has these good aspects, there are many problems with the story. Roth changes the focus of the story, redirecting it to a place beyond the ruined city of the factions. She incorporates an entirely new plot that not only causes the book to turn away from the city that is supposed to be the main focus, but also seriously complicates the plot with a government that also has some big issues. By adding another broken government, it completely takes away the goal of the entire book series, and that is to heal the city.By including another government, this also adds to another problem this book has and that is all the unanswered questions: who rules the government? What shape is the country in? Why is Tris the only Divergent to ever have been tested and have three factions? Does her brother Caleb ever get why it was wrong to help the woman who tried to kill his sister, or is he still completely oblivious?Probably the biggest issue with Allegiant is the ending. Allegiant does something that the other books do not do, and that is have both Tris and Tobias' point of views. The inclusion of Tobias is great at first, but by the end the true reason of its presence is realized, and it is not what readers are expecting. The general response for the ending is going to be split among the readers; part of the readers will become extremely angry over what happens, and the other part will be happy that Roth ended differently than other mainstream books and praise its uniqueness. The last part of the book is going to be controversial among fans, and since the movie company for the series, Red Wagon Entertainment, is already slotted to film Insurgent, the second book in the series, it will be interesting to see how it will play out.Though parts of the book were entertaining, attention grabbing, and thought provoking, the crowded and complicated plot, the unanswered questions, and the questionable ending, causes Allegiant to fall short of a climatic finale to the series.For more reviews check out my blog: [...]", "reviewerName": "The Night Owl", "summary": "One Choice Will Define This Book", "helpful": [8, 12], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1382659200, "reviewerID": "A9MO9WK5DH31P"}

{"reviewTime": "03 25, 2014", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Author Veronica Roth presents readers with an ambitious concept in the Divergent trilogy.  It works, to a certain extent.  The story arc will certainly make readers consider the consequences of discriminating against people with differences, no matter what form those differences take.  But in her attempt to pull in the intended YA audience of the books, Roth lets logic and story progression flounder.Tris, Tobias, and the others discover that the Bureau monitors people almost to a point of obsession, and at certain points Tris ponders the ethical implication of the fact that the Bureau could have stepped in to help and only watched on TV instead.  So it&#8217;s a little hard to believe that an organization that tracks its experiment subjects so closely would not exercise the same caution within its own physical headquarters.  That&#8217;s exactly what Roth would have readers believe; Tris and Co. manage to plan and engage in an uprising without once getting discovered.  No hidden cameras or microphones keep tabs on the Bureau&#8217;s own employees, which seems a little more than far-fetched.Also, most of Tris and Tobias&#8217; encounters early in the book deal with their make out sessions, and after a while it gets tedious to the point of encouraging readers to skip paragraphs to read about them kissing yet again.  Roth seems to want to drill the idea into the heads of her readers that the two teens love one another.  We get it.  They like each other.  They&#8217;re physically attracted to one another.  And because this isn&#8217;t a grownup book, they can&#8217;t exactly consummate that love every 10 pages.  By the fourth or fifth kiss, readers will probably feel relieved that that&#8217;s all they do.  Anything more would pull this novel in a different direction.I also had a real problem with the death of a particular character.  I won&#8217;t name the person, but I have to say that after reading through that passage I found it hard to believe that Roth would make this choice in the story.  It doesn&#8217;t add anything of value to lose this person; in fact, it almost feels like she decided to do it to justify another literary device that readers will find different from the first and second books.That device&#8212;adding Tobias as a first-person narrator&#8212;feels jarring.  In the first two books we hear the entire story from Tris&#8217; point of view.  In Allegiant Tobias gets to come into the spotlight to share his side of things, and this immediately puts distance between the readers and the characters.  It feels akin to Stephenie Meyer&#8217;s choice to share the point of view responsibility in the last Twilight book, and I didn&#8217;t like it then either.I loved the main idea that Roth presented&#8212;the experiment of the factions&#8212;but I feel like her execution of the actual story let the entire series down.  I would recommend this book only to readers of the first two so they can find out what happens, but I wouldn&#8217;t tell people to start the series if they haven&#8217;t already done so.", "reviewerName": "The Write Edge", "summary": "I agree with all the other reviews here...", "helpful": [1, 1], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewerID": "AKU2NYKROFG9L"}
{"reviewTime": "11 6, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "This is definitely one of the hardest novels I've had to review in quite some time....and that's mostly because my feelings for Allegiant are, as they say, all over the place! I desperately wanted to be able to write this review and be &#34;frolicking through fields&#34; as I told you how great it was, but I can't lie bookworms, I'm kind of heartbroken and disappointed with it.I'm sure by now it's no secret to any of you that Allegiant is told in both Tris and Four's perspective. Initially when I heard this news, I was super excited to get a further glimpse into Four's mind. However, although I did enjoy seeing his perspective (especially in regards to what he feels and sees when he looks at Tris) I found his &#34;voice&#34; wasn't all that different from Tris', which made it a little confusing at times to tell whose POV I was reading from when I forgot to look at the chapter title. Once I reached the end of Allegiant (after I dried up my tears.....for the millionth time) I realized how important it was to have Four's perspective thrown in there. I will say that although some people found Four to be a bit annoying in Allegiant, I really loved seeing that vulnerability within him shine through and I think that is one of the reasons why Allegiant 's ending was so hard to deal with.Tris and Four continued to be one of my favourite kick-ass, bring-it-on couples that still manage to make me swoon over their beautiful connection.They had a mix of both affectionate and distant moments-- and my one complaint would have to be the fact that their trust in one another continued to be tested in Allegiant. I found this element to their relationship a little annoying because I thought this was an obstacle they had already dealt with and resolved in Insurgent. The one thing I really love about these two is that although they are stronger together, they're both still independent on their own. I was particularly impressed to see Tris stand up against Four when he made a not so smart decision and not be afraid to throw it in his face. Tris is one of the strongest and bravest heroines I've ever read about and she proves that on numerous occasions!Now comes the hard part.....the ending.....*takes deep breath to hold in the waterfall made from my tears* I'm sure by now most of you who are reading this already know from either reading the novel or through spoilers what happens at the end of Allegiant, but I 'm going to try and keep this spoiler free anyways. I know that over the past week or so there have been those who are upset/angry with the ending and those who are defending Veronica Roth's right to end the series the way she always intended to. Although I completely agree that Veronica has absolutely no obligation to make me as a reader happy, that doesn't mean I'm obligated to be happy with how she chooses to do so. At first, I was pretty angry (and obviously heartbroken) over how this incredible series ended, but after some time, I am now just really numb about it. The soul of the series has been ripped away and that really has effected how I look back on the series as a whole. I don't know if I'll ever be able to look back on the happy moments without focusing on the ending I know that's in store for these characters. There are those that look at the ending as a display of bravery that wraps up the series beautifully, but I can't help but look at it as a tragic and heart breaking ending that takes away the theme of hope that I loved so much about this series. I'm definitely disappointed and even more so heartbroken----when I finished Allegiant, I had the whole &#34;quivering lips, big fat tears&#34; thing going on for a good hour (not even exaggerating)....I'm still in a mourning period. ...Overall, my thoughts on Allegiant are definitely not positive even though I enjoyed a majority of this novel up until its ending. I'm filled with anger and shock, but mostly disappointment that these characters I've grown to love in such a consuming way didn't get the ending I thought they deserved. The more and more I think about it, the less satisfied I am. I'm now not sure whether I'd be able to recommend this series to anyone in the future because as great as 95% of this series was, that last 5% makes me want to erase this series from my mind so I wouldn't have to deal with the pain I'm currently going through. It's unfortunate to see a series end in a way that divides the fandom so much due to it's controversy as opposed to bringing us together for closure.", "reviewerName": "The Y.A.

Especially Allegiant touched me deeply and in my opinion it was the perfect ending, but I will explain my reasoning if you read further on.In Allegiant the world Tris believed to know doesn't exist anymore. The factions are gone and the city suffers from violence and suppression. Tris wants to flee from this place in order to find out what lies behind the big fence, and she is willing to risk everything in order to get out. But what she discovers is not something she expected and Tris and Tobias are confronted with more lies and a devastating truth.I came to love a lot of old side characters in the final book. Especially Christina and Uriah were one of my favourites, because they really are true friends for Tris and Tobias.Tobias, however, makes a few really bad decisions in Allegiant, because he doesn't know who he is anymore. I could understand his reasoning, but I also found it quite frustrating that he didn't listen to Tris at all. I don't know if I had been able to forgive him just like Tris did, but I guess Tobias was punishing himself enough.The relationship between Tobias and Tris doesn't get any easier in this book, quite the opposite actually. It even comes to the point where both of them doubt if there is any chance for them to trust each other again. It almost broke my heart, but it was also very refreshing. There is no easy love in Allegiant and there is no insta-love either. So many YA books focus too much on the romance part and it often seems like nothing that happens could make the protagonists loose their feelings towards each other.This is a true dystopian series in every aspect:The world is not perfect, and even the &#34;solution&#34; is not perfect either. It makes sense and that is the most important part. The reader has to realise that in a dystopian series nothing is even slightly perfect.No easy love. Relationships are complicated and very emotionally depressing. That is real life. Love is not always about kissing and making out, standing up for each other etc. Sometimes love also means that you hurt the other person deeply and that to forgive is even harder than to forget.No HEA. Yes, I guess there is no real HEA in Allegiant. But it was the perfect ending. It was a true dystopian ending. If you think about it, maybe you notice it, too.The Yearning Mermaid says: &#34;I think it was perfect. I really loved it, but I can also understand that many people didn't like it so much.

I originally rated this two stars but as I sat down to write this review, I asked myself &#8216;what did I like about this book?&#8217;  And the only answer I came up with was &#8216;at least it&#8217;s over&#8217;.  I can&#8217;t give this book two stars, and it pains me that it has come to this.Let&#8217;s start with the dual POV.  This is becoming a popular thing, and I&#8217;m fine with it as long as it is done well and there is a reason for it.  I was actually kind of excited to hear Four&#8217;s take on things.  Or I thought I was anyway.  This reads like what not to do if you attempt dual POV.  Tris and Four ended up sounding so much alike that I would be reading along and then it would refer to something Tris did across the room and I&#8217;d be all- &#8220;wait-whaaat I thought we were Tris this chapter *flips back* oh.  We are Four, oops&#8221;.  This didn&#8217;t even just happen once or twice, it was constant.The character growth in this book was  non-existent.  I&#8217;d go so far as to say  some of them regressed and a few went completely crazy for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Four has always been a strong, level-headed character but after hearing some news he doesn&#8217;t like he suddenly completely ignores everything Tris says and does a bunch of stupid things without thinking twice about it.  Umm, isn&#8217;t he the one always getting on to Tris for being reckless and not thinking things through enough?Guess what&#8217;s outside the wall?  Swiss-cheese plot that makes no sense! I&#8217;m not a geneticist or even Bill Nye for that matter- but this is not how it works.  Did these scientists graduate from the University of Looney Tunes?Everybody is freaking out about the ending and I am too but not at all for the same reason.  I thought it was just ridiculous. I do not understand how what they did would even fix the issues except for temporarily.  What they did affects one place, when we learn early on this is a national issue.  This is also not how government works.Some of the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; are foiled with what is possibly the stupidest things I have ever heard in my entire life.  This is apparently how you change power hungry, evil people:A) Offer them something they gave up willingly before and seemingly never wanted to do in exchange for giving up what has been their entire life goal.B) Tell them they are not the boss.I decided to experiment with this before I condemned it as completely worthless.  So I tried these tactics out on my seven year old, my two year old, my hubby and our pack of dogs.  The seven year old listened intently then proceeded to choose to continue exactly what he was doing in the first place.  The two year old (a tiny, much prettier Napoleon really) enjoyed the &#8216;I&#8217;m the boss!&#8217; &#8216;No, I&#8217;m the boss!&#8217; game but ultimately continued to color the table with her markers instead of the coloring book.  The significant other blinked at me a few times then asked if I was getting enough sleep.  The dogs just tilted their heads and kept looking at eachother.  I&#8217;m no Cesar Millan but I&#8217;m pretty sure they were making fun of me.  You know what didn&#8217;t happen?  No one magically decided to do exactly what I wanted.  I now, officially, proclaim these tactics bs.The final crime of this book is that it was written so shoddily that I felt nothing when the big shock came.  I didn&#8217;t cry or even tear up and that was the point when I realized how much this book had killed what was previously a much beloved series.I don&#8217;t know what happened to her writing between the first two books and this one, but this felt like really bad fan-fiction.

Don&#8217;t let the low score fool you, the central theme from those who didn&#8217;t like Allegiant is all about the ending.  I&#8217;ll not spoil it but I will say that it was perfectly fine by me in terms of how she handled her characters.  Look, this whole series was about loyalty, identify, relationships, and principles.  When you mix those ingredients and add the human condition you get a big mess &#8211; most of us go through a period of being a human train wreck, particularly when we&#8217;re young.  No different with Tris, Tobias and crew.  If you&#8217;re looking for a clean ending that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy you&#8217;ll be disappointed.  If you expect that, like real life, some people sometimes lose the big hand in the card game then you&#8217;ll be fine with how this one wraps up.  I will only say that Veronica Roth (and if you&#8217;ve read the other books in the series) isn&#8217;t afraid to schwack a character&#8230;she&#8217;s no George Marin by any stretch but she&#8217;ll kill one here or there to add some context.The good and bad:  I&#8217;m older so the teeny-bopper relationship struggles and bickering didn&#8217;t resonate but it sure looked a lot like some of the stuff kids go through in those early years when they have that first real relationship. I won&#8217;t argue holes in the plot because there were some but the Orwellian flavor to this dystopian fantasy really appealed to me.

But when you have a Kindle you can just buy the next the book the second your finished with the first. Insurgent was good but not as good the first and it ended with a cliffhanger. So, I had to buy Allegiant, right? I now tell all my friends and strangers on the street to just STOP at the end of Divergent. I also, tell people about the review by Penny that is \"the most helpful\" 1 Star review here on Amazon. And recently I found an essay by Penny just on the ending of book 3. Here is the link to that: [...]If there is not a link you can search \"breaking down the ending to Allegiant\" and it should pop up.Now here is my beef with this godawful terrible excuse for a book I wish I had never read:***Spoilers***FOUR/TOBIAS DESERVED BETTERI hated how she changed his character into a \"pansycake\" in this book. But I really hated that Roth thought so little of him that she would take away the ONLY person who ever truly loved him!!! When Tris died, I felt for him more than for her. That was so wrong on so many levels. Tobias of all the characters deserved better, we all did.AN ANTI-HERO DEATH, WHAT THE HECK???I'm ok with a main character dying. I can't think of a literary example right now, so I go to Braveheart. Main character dies very sad, BUT he died for a noble cause & the rest of the story has a rally of the troops and a victorious end. So, you are sad but satisfied. A real life example for a Texan like me would be The Alamo. We lost the battle BUT THEN WE WON THE WAR!!! But Roth did not give us a rally or a victorious end. It was almost like she said, \"Well, I killed Tris which is what I set out to do no matter how contrived I have to make this story and so I'm done. Oh, wait I need to wrap up some stuff. Hummmmm. How should I do that? I don't know. I'll just write some cliches and platitudes and be done. No one will notice that Tris died in an anti-hero nonsensical non-victorious way.\"ROTH RUINED TRIS BEFORE THE ENDShe turned Tris into a know-it-all with an attitude and then in the end she loses her moral compass. So, her death was just the last nail on the coffin for me. Well, I thought it was the last nail until one of the last lines of the book \"Life sucks...you just gotta find the parts that don't\" (paraphrasing what Christina said), then that was another nail for me. And I think Roth has a really warped since of sacrifice for a 16 year old girl (see, Breaking down ending).This is what I lost by reading Allegiant:ToriThe importance of the cityThe importance of being DivergentTobias I loved from book 1UriahChristina? Where's Christina? Just Tris's sidekick.Tris's heart & intelligenceSo, by the time I lost Tris...I had already lost so much, it just made me angry and raw. Roth killed more than just Tris for me.PLOT HOLESI could go on and on about how Roth and the stupid editors (the editors share some blame too!) could've made this book so much better. And I will for a little while. They could've butched up Tobias so we could tell who was narrating the freaking story! \"Wait. Who is telling me all this? Oh! Tobias because I just read 'Tris said'.\" I mean COME ON! Any person off the street could've pointed out the dual POV mess. Where were the editors? The MANY plot holes could've been fixed. David basically told everyone the pass word when he shouted out \"HER!\" while looking at Tris. I am 99% sure the pass word was NATALIE, Tris's mom. And speaking of Nat, why wouldn't she stop everything and get her own daughter out of the city if that was her job to save Divergents? How did they place Natalie into Dauntless at 15 and no one in that faction went, \"Where did this girl with no parents come from???\". Ok. I'll stop now. Though I could go on and on.This is how I rate the series:Divergent B+Insurgent C+Allegiant FTHE MOVIESI really enjoyed, Divergent, the movie though. It was nice to see the Four I loved (and Theo James is hot!)back and it helped wash away what Roth did to him in book 3. I will probably not see movie #2 and WILL NOT see the last movie becasue I am not masochist.JUST IMOTwo Dystopian YA series I've read recently that I enjoyed:The Testing (book 1&2, book 3 comes out in June so it might all go to hell...)The Match Series by Ally Condie. Really liked this series a lot. Love and respect throughout was a nice change. And I thought Ally's writing style was like poetry sometimes.WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN \"OUTSIDE THE FENCE\"I was thinking that Divergent actually MEANT something and was important and would've helped whoever or whatever was \"outside the fence\" like the video said. I was thinking they would encounter a huge mess of a destroyed civilization, that made Chicago look new. Maybe find a rundown government installation (kinda like the Bureau place but run down) that was run by a skeletal crew. A few families, that had been there waiting for generations. One of them would have been Tris's cousin. That the city was part of a rebel group trying to overthrow a corrupted government that controlled people with the serums, to \"keep peace\" at all cost. That the world was so destroyed that the corrupt government that is set up west of The Rockies because the rest of America was so destroyed. So desolate that no one ever wanted to go east in over a 100 years, thinking the rebels were long dead. No planes, or satellites anymore either. So, when Tris & Co. show up at the Rebel HQ, it's a surprise and cause for celebration because now they can go and free everyone west of the Rockies. But their joy is short lived after hearing that civil war is about to break out in the city. So, they all have to go back to into the city and try and stop the war, which would not be Tobias having a heart-to-heart with his Mom.Then I'm kinda out. Ha! I just don't want to negate what happened in the last two books with what is outside the fence.Or maybe go all sci-fi and an Alien race has taken over earth after we almost destroyed it with war and they are trying to rid humanity of violence without taking away our free will. So, they set up the city as an experiment, but then after seeing the city about to go to war they decide the human race isn't worth saving. So, Tris & Co. fight the Aliens and win and save the world. ;-)Or maybe Zombies! Yeah, Zombies have taken over and they won't eat Divergents.And I'm so mad that I see more 5 Star ratings for this book and so it's got 3 1/2 Stars instead of 3 like it did a month ago. Ugh! People please go and write your own 1 Star review if you hated or did not like this book! Don't just depend on Penny.MY ALTERNATIVE ENDING:Allegiant is fiction and I have a great imagination. So I've made up my own ending and I've repeated to myself over and over again and it's kind of working. I'm starting to believe it. There's no way I was touching the GP/GD mess. But my ending is this:Caleb in all the craziness slips away from the guards and makes it to vault. The death serum has evaporated and he is able to get to the doorway unnoticed. He hears the conversation and because he is so calculating he knows a split second before Tris dives for the memory serum box thingy and so he runs and dives in taking the bullets for her. Tris holds his hand while he is dying and says \"You ARE forgiven.\" Caleb smiles and closes his eyes and is gone.2 1/2 years later: Tobias AND Tris are on top of the building with everyone else to scatter Caleb's ashes. He was the last of her blood family left and it has taken her this long to finally let go. She knows that Tobias & her friends are her family now. And she is looking forward to the future standing by his side.Tobias goes first down the zip line. Tris follows and she flies down, letting go of Caleb and freeing herself from the pain of the past. She feels absolutely free and the sun is setting and it is beautiful.There. Now repeat. And repeat. It's kinda of working. ;-)", "reviewerName": "Tiffany", "summary": "I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW MUCH I HATED THIS BOOK", "helpful": [4, 5], "overall": 1.0, "unixReviewTime": 1392508800, "reviewerID": "AVLOYKZ9H7A39"}

She then read Insurgent and thought it was okay.  She kind of forgets about the series until Allegiant was released in the winter of 2013.  Everybody started buzzing about the unexpected ending to Allegiant so Tina decides to read it...but first she had to reread Insurgent because she basically forgot about what happened in it.  It turns out that she enjoyed reading Insurgent a second time a lot more than the first.  Now it's June, 2014, and Tina has just finished Allegiant. She thought it was okay...and is now writing a review for it.anybody still listening?Hello? Are you still there? Did I bore you with my story? Well, that's kind of how I felt about Allegiant for 50% of the reading. The beginning was pretty good, the middle seemed to drag, and then the action picked up again towards the end.I loved Divergent because there was so much action!But in Allegiant, I feel like a large part of the novel was about putting in perspective how the faction system was only an &#34;experiment&#34; and that a whole other world existed outside of the city and that there are GPs and GDs--aka, info dumping.  I desperately wished there was some action scenes to spice up all of these revelations Tris is having because....well, I got bored to be frank.  (BTW, I'm going off track here--but when I take notes for school I abbreviate a lot so whenever I saw GD I thought &#34;Great Depression&#34; and GP I thought &#34;genetic potential&#34;...it was a bit distracting, lol)Also, did anyone else think that when Tris and Four weren't arguing, they were making out like, every two minutes??? The overbearing focus on their relationship reminded me that of Rebel's.  I loved their sweet relationship in the first two books, but now I'm like Eek! Enough already! Please focus on saving the world!Alright, enough said about the negatives and let's move onto the positives.  I really enjoyed the dual POV Roth takes on the novel with--it offered some nice insight regard what's going on inside Four's mind.  Is it bad that I found the ending refreshing? ***Spoiler Alert--not that there's much to spoil considering everyone knows how Allegiant ends unless you've been living under a rock***  There are way too many predictable endings out there...okay, maybe that's too broad of a term.  Let me rephrase that sentence: 99% of the time, the main character lives.  Even in Farewell to Arms , a rather depressing book where like, everyone dies, the main character still lives.  So it definitely threw me off when my friends told me Tris dies at the end.Final thoughts? Loved Divergent and enjoyed Insurgent as well.  Am I glad that I read Allegiant? Yes.

It's not that they are bad books, because I really liked the initial concept. I'm just not quite sure if it was well thought out all the way through the end.Allegiant is told from dual perspective (Tris and Four) and in the beginning the difference of tone was clear, but about halfway through I had to double check a couple of times whom's pov I was currently reading. The difference between Tris and Four' voices got lost somewhere and it was almost the same, meaning it felt all like it was coming for Tris. Four has changed a lot since the first book and I am not sure if I'm really liking the new one. Where he used to be strong and confident, he is now insecure and often filled with doubt.I still think Tris is the most interesting character in this book. With her being Divergent and having tendencies towards three different factions, gives her a very complex and contradictory personality. She has also grown throughout the books, but has become stronger and more confident in her choices.The relationships between the different characters was probably the most interesting to me. Those constantly changing dynamics between friends, family and enemies, almost nothing stayed the same. Other than that I was pretty much bored throughout this last one. Suddenly there seems to be a whole new plot and there is not enough foundation for it to really go somewhere.If you haven't read the book, but you have read the reviews then you know everyone's been talking about the end. I have to agree with most, that it sucked. The whole build up was good, but then Veronica Roth made one decision that I just could not agree with. Of course that is a personal opinion.Finishing this series I have trouble understanding why it was picked up for a movie. It's a fun YA read, but like I said, I was not wowed by it.

I really loved Allegiant and I just can't stop thinking about it! It left me speechless.Allegiant picks up briefly after where Insurgent left off. The faction system is crumbling and Tris is given the chance to go outside the fence. Roth has done an excellent job with developing these characters through the course of this series. Tris is definitely on my list of top protagonists. I like that she has been affected by everything she has seen and lived through because it makes her more realistic. She is this strong girl, but she still has her flaws and weaknesses. I also felt that I really understood her motives and decisions in this book.Then I loved that Allegiant was also told in Tobias' point of view. He is another character who has come so far since Divergent and has been developed really well. I loved that reading his point of view gave me some new insight into his mind and motives. I also really loved how the relationship has grown between Tris and Tobias. Then I loved getting to see the return of some of my favorite characters, like Christina, and getting to meet some new characters as well.From the moment I started this book, I couldn't put it down. I was completely captivated from the beginning to the end. The plot had action, romance, and twists that I didn't expect. The alternating point of views flowed really well and made the story move along more quickly. I also loved learning even more about this world and seeing what was outside the fence. All of my questions were definitely answered. Then I have to say that in this book especially, Roth's writing was beautiful. There were so many times that I would pause to write down a quote.Overall I loved Allegiant! It made me smile, laugh, and cry a lot. I plan on rereading this series over and over again very soon.

But apparently that's what most of the reviews on Amazon seem to think. The author can and should do whatever pleases them and not to say it shouldn't affect the readers (it does) but it amazes me how people seem to think it's all about them and their feelings. No, this series does not end happily. For a number of reasons. But how utterly boring and predictable would it have been if things had gone exactly to plan? I was actually surprised by what happened. It caught me off guard but I applaud the author for doing what she did because in hindsight, it was probably the best course to take.Now, that said, this is the least entertaining book in the Divergent series. It's overly long and quite dull in a few areas. There is lots of talking, not much doing, and aside from the plot twist near the end, the climax was a let-down. The mystery surrounding the first two books gets dissolved here, but not in any inspiring way. We don't really get much that left us surprised or on the edge of our seats.Tobias, AKA Four was an interesting character back in Book 1, but here he's dragging his feet, moping the whole book and doing really nothing of interest or importance. Tris spends the book feeling either agitated or guilty and she can't seem to reconcile her feelings. The secondary characters don't provide much curiosity or entertainment. The whole mood of this book differs greatly from the other two. It almost doesn't feel part of the Divergent series. It's hard to explain unless you read it, but that's the way I felt through the whole book.All in all I was disappointed. Not at the way it ended, but the journey to the end.

{"reviewTime": "12 6, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "My thoughts on Allegiant as I was reading through the book (oh, and by the way, I heard THE spoiler before I got to read it, grrr):The beginning was pretty boring. Talking, planning, some more talking, running - oh, look, someone died. Even once they got outside the fence I had to force myself to keep reading.THEN things started getting explained, and it was totally interesting and I was fascinated (I must be Erudite). I don't know if it's just me, but when Tris and Tobias realized the truth about their city it seemed to make the dystopian setting of this series a HUNDRED times more realistic - to me, at least - not seeming so much like a fantasy instead, like, say, The Hunger Games. I mean, I'M pretty sure a place called Panem will never exist, and the government will never make people fight in bloody televised Games. With the conclusion to the series, the Divergent Trilogy almost seemed like it could happen one day, and I know I was living in it while I was reading.So, the whole picture of this whole series was finally coming together, and the plot started coming together, and Tris and Tobias were having amazingly realistic, but heartbreaking, difficulties in their relationship, and there was action, and character revelations, and new serums (YES!! There goes my Erudite side again . . .) and then -Then.The ending.At first I was like, \"This is stupid!\" but mostly just, \"WWWHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!\" I was even crying a little.Once I calmed down, this was what I thought of the ending: It was realistic and I respect Veronica Roth for writing it. Obviously, my heart ached for the other characters, one person in PARTICULAR. (For those of you who haven't read the book yet, it should be pretty obvious that it's a character death.) And I settled with: I think the book is better with the ending the way it is. It wouldn't be as good another way. I think people are getting way too worked up over it. It was good. Great, even. And besides, it's done, so deal with it.Now, for the pros and cons.Pros: Tris isn't acting annoying and emotional like she was in Insurgent (I wanted to slap her SO hard then), the Fourtris is better than ever, there are new characters every bit as good as the old ones, the writing is great, the whole plot is explained, the action is intense, things are resolved, Tris has some amazing thoughts on important things in life, like courage and love . . . yeah. It has loads of good stuff. (After I finish with this review I'm going to go look up a bunch of Allegiant quotes and \"like\" them.)Cons: Like I said, the beginning was a bit slow, and obviously, the ending was a bummer but sort of had to be there, and I agree with the other reviews: Tobias's point of view was a bit too similar to Tris's. Oh, and what was up with Amar \"liking\" Tobias? Seriously? Did I totally read into that wrong or what? Nothing even came out of it!Warnings: Too many to write. Nothing extreme, but watch out for language, violence, and \"young adult\" romance (if you've read enough young adult books you'll know what I mean by that). I'd say it's 14+, and the theme is darker and more intense than the previous novels.Biggest pro: It's just an excellent novel.

{"reviewTime": "12 1, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Originally posted on Zemfirka Blogs.Mild spoilers aheadIt&#8217;s been over a month since release of Allegiant and I&#8217;m still trying to write a satisfactory review, it just seems like an impossible task. In fact my original draft review is ashamedly sitting waiting for me to look at it. It wasn&#8217;t good, or honest, or raw, it was more of a polite reaction to the end of what could&#8217;ve been one of the best YA dystopian trilogies. At this point, I think I really need to learn my lesson and not expect these trilogies to end well, they all simply underwhelm and disappoint [yes, I&#8217;m looking at you Matched and Delirium]. But don&#8217;t get me wrong, for all its faults I still believe Divergent series is one of the better ones out there and definitely worth reading.&#8220;I am not all right. I was beginning to feel that I had finally found a place to stay, a place that was not so unstable or corrupt or controlling that I could actually belong there. You would think that I would have learned by now&#8212; such a place does not exist.&#8221; Allegiant (p. 276).I might&#8217;ve not loved Allegiant and it wasn&#8217;t the greatest or strongest book in the series, but not because of the &#8220;shocking&#8221; character death that was causing so much backlash over the social media. Surprisingly, I found Veronica&#8217;s choice almost appropriate; this book needed it. [Yes. There, I said it &#8211; please don&#8217;t hate me.] I know it was a heartbreaking moment for a lot of fans out there, but not every book needs a happily ever after to be great, or even good and the world of Divergent warranted this sacrifice.However, my biggest struggle had to do with the characters themselves, their actions and the final reveal of the outside world. Halfway through I&#8217;ve struggled to keep myself reading; this, once creative world and idea of the story started to feel repetitive. The science tie-in, the experiments and hours spent between Tris and Four always fighting or making out, it was exasperating. We were stuck in a vicious circle of their broken relationship and there was no escape, things were falling apart, the cusp was so close that I almost wished for them to cross it.These characters were deeply flawed and I felt my love and investment in their relation deteriorating with each page, but perhaps it was also the glory part of Allegiant. Veronica&#8217;s goal was to portray broken people and see them improve and mend themselves in the process of their struggle and in that, she succeeded. There is clear character growth and development that beautifully underlines this harsh dystopian world, and at the end there is hope that something can be rebuilt but not forgotten, which I think is important.&#8220;There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes bravery involves laying down your life for something bigger than yourself, or for someone else. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved, for the sake of something greater. But sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life.&#8221; Allegiant (p. 509).So whether you love it or hate it, this book certainly inspires enough emotion to make it worth reading.

But alas, it&#8217;s not my story.I&#8217;m going to write this review differently than I usually do, organizing my thoughts around the major points of discussion.THE TRUTH&#8220;There&#8217;s so much that was a lie, it&#8217;s hard to figure out what was true, what was real, what matters.&#8221;We finally learn the truth behind the factions, behind who everyone really is and why. So much of this series has been about understanding who you are, what you believe in, who you align with. At the beginning of the series, it&#8217;s about choosing your faction according to your true self, your true motivations. In Allegiant, it&#8217;s more about what makes you, YOU. It&#8217;s about defining yourself beyond the factions, leaving the characters to ponder who they are intrinsically. This notion is particularly significant for Tobias, who has grown up with one tyrant as a parent, and another who was thought dead and was not, and subsequently has become a tyrant.  It was evident in this book just how broken Tobias really was, how desperate he was to believe he&#8217;s more than the result of his parents.&#8220;I was afraid of my considerable capacity to kill&#8230;That was the first time I&#8217;ve ever said those words out loud, and now I hear how strange they are. How many young men fear that there is a monster inside of them?&#8221;Roth takes an allegorical approach to defining the characters, enlivening the nature versus nurture debate. But I believe that in the end she makes the point that who you are is defined by what you do for the people you love and for the things you believe in.&#8220;I don&#8217;t belong to Abnegation, or Dauntless, or even the Divergent&#8230; I belong to the people I love, and they belong to me-they, and the love and loyalty I give them, form my identity far more than any word or group ever could.&#8221;Another issue for me was that there are a lot of groups battling each other and it truthfully got a little confusing. It was almost as if Roth just packed way too much into the plot and made it more complicated than it needed to be. I was constantly trying to discern who was who, if they were good or bad, who the &#8220;good&#8221; group should be and what the &#8220;right&#8221; thing was in the end. I&#8217;m all for digging deep and making it challenging for the reader, but you don&#8217;t want to push it so far that it gets too confounding and the reader checks out.DUAL POVSThis was one of the aspects I was most excited about and perhaps one of the ones I&#8217;m most disappointed with. The alternating POVs were too similar, almost monotone at times. I actually had to go back and check whose narrative I was reading a few times. I felt like I wanted Four&#8217;s POV to be stronger and more striking. He lost a little of his ethos in my opinion. I totally get (and like) the fact that he was broken and part of his character&#8217;s arc was to work through those issues, but he just wasn&#8217;t as badass as I wanted him to be. He felt weak and clumsy at times. On the other hand, I liked the insight it gave me into how Four felt about Tris. On some level, they really are kindred spirits&#8230; so alike in their resoluteness and bravery, but their internal struggles and motivations are divergent (no pun intended) and that causes a rift to grow between them. Nonetheless, it was fulfilling to see how much they did love each other despite their differences.&#8220;He is stronger than anyone I know, and warmer than anyone else realizes; he is a secret that I have kept, and will keep, for the rest of my life.&#8221;BE BRAVE&#8220;I suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last.&#8221;In the acknowledgements, Veronica Roth tells her readers to &#8220;be brave&#8221; and I do think a lot of the story revolves around bravery, weaving in moments of tremendous courage in its plot twists. Brave choices. Brave sacrifices. Brave abandon. I liked this thematic framework and was really moved by her words on bravery at the story&#8217;s conclusion&#8230; I would say it brought me to tears, but I was already shedding them at that point. And perhaps, taking a cue from Dauntless, Veronica Roth&#8217;s intent was to be brave in how she ended the story. Personally, I DO NOT mind endings that are emblematic, especially in the dystopian genre where happy endings are not a fair expectation, I just honestly didn&#8217;t think her choices were necessary.I think most readers likely already know there are deaths in the conclusion and I tried to process the impact of what happens through the choices of others who have made similar choices. In George R.R. Martin&#8217;s desultory approach to offing characters in his The Song of Fire and Ice series, he has such a large cast of characters that the story lives on beyond the deaths it racks up, there is no one impervious to death in his books and you get that point from day one. The expectation is set&#8230; a silent contract signed between author and reader, and the story continues to take shape after the deaths (although many were indeed shocking). In Breaking Bad, the final death in the series is absolutely necessary and there is no other way the story should end.  On the flip side, for all you Dexter fans, he, on the other hand, should have died, not lived. In making choices to kill characters &#8211; main or supporting &#8211; one must do so with care&#8230; it has to feel right and necessary. Allegiant&#8217;s story, in my opinion, could&#8217;ve gone in a completely different direction and still imparted a bigger, thoughtful message with incredible power. It was too unexpected and unwarranted, in my opinion. I won&#8217;t reveal how it ended obviously, but in my mind I envisioned it end in hand-to-hand/watch it burn kind-of style. I was left not only with my grief, but with a dissatisfaction that one of our protagonists was not happy and I strongly feel that happiness was well deserved after everything that had transpired leading up to the final moments.&#8220;There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes bravery involves laying down your life for something bigger than yourself, or for someone else. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved, for the sake of something greater.But sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life.That is the sort of bravery I must have now.&#8221;IN SUMMARYThis isn&#8217;t a boring book. It was well written, embedding many heartfelt moments I desperately wanted. I also really loved how she weaved in some flashbacks from Divergent&#8230; those were incredibly powerful scenes with good timing. I admit, I cried a little harder remembering those times. I LOVED the first two books, I just didn&#8217;t understand all her choices. In the end, I&#8217;m not ready to burn my books or start any kind of riot.  If you are a fan of the first two books, don&#8217;t avoid the third just because of opinions like mine or that of others. Finish the series, see it through to the end. Personally, I&#8217;m glad I read this book, I really am, and I do think the end was powerful nonetheless. I leave you with Veronica Roth&#8217;s own words from Allegiant&#8230;&#8220;Some things are hard to let go of.&#8221;", "reviewerName": "Vilma's Book Blog", "summary": "Thought-provoking.

{"reviewTime": "11 3, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I found the Divergent  series quite by accident. Having grown up in my youth on classic Sci-fi writers like Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert, and Isaac Asimov, I wanted to branch out and read some new contemporary writers. I also had a strong interest in reading more dystopia fiction and a few google searches later I stumbled upon Divergent.Divergent was a solid novel and while it was a gripping dystopian styled political commentary on  class division and the social injustice racial profiling I can't say I was all that gripped with the budding romance of Trish and Four/Tobias, perhaps it was because I was not a teenage girl (I did not know that was the target group). Yet since I am a sucker for a good coming of age story I did in the end get sucked in. Insurrection I found to have a lot \"filler\" in it but was a needed story to bring Trish well up to and past Tobias in maturity, skill, and leadership. It also helped fill in all the questions about the fractions that Divergent left out.However, it is was really Allegiant that to me was the shining gem of them all. I know from reading other's reviews that most fans panned this novel and and enraged there is no happy ending and feel cheated. Putting aside the love story for a minute I have to say the writing of this installment was far beyond anything Veronica Roth did in the other two books. The central plot idea that the whole Fraction society is really a government experiment to produce divergents who are really genetically pure people needed for rebuilding society on the \"outside\" was a brilliant hidden plot that I never saw coming. Even more brilliant was showing that the \"outside\" was mimicking the Fractions without even knowing it!Much criticism has circled around the dueling first person accounts of Trish and Tobias. Many said they found it confusing and that Trish and Tobias sounded to much a like (which i did not notice). However, I'd point out that it was a literary necessity because of the death of Trish. If she remained the narrator it would have ended the book right away. Secondly, I'd add Veronica Roth is a young writer (literally in age and experience) and I felt it was the right thing for her too do as a writer least she hinder her writing style growth.Perhaps the death of Trish is the most hotly controversial event that has thousands of teenage girls up in arms. I'd just hope that they don't forget that this trilogy is was about perceived power being found in politics and warfare vs sacrificial love. Trish was had a heritage of sacrificial love in her parents. She had been sickly suicidal in the whole second novel and willing to give her life away to ride her guilt. By contrast in Allegiant her sacrifice is finally for the right reason and it not only forever heals Caleb but it gives liberty to thousands. She showed by her actions love is greater then war. My only grip is that I wish Tobias would have went on to explore and liberate more cities in Tirsh's honor rather then return to his.I will be looking for my work from Veronica Roth because I feel her work it maturing and the best is yet to come. Hopefully, her next work is a whole new story (which will help her grow as a writer).", "reviewerName": "Vince Macisaac \"Vinnie\"", "summary": "Much better the the reviews on here give it credit for", "helpful": [4, 11], "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383436800, "reviewerID": "A3S43CQ832KY3K"}

This last book is a disappointment.First of all I feel like it was written at a 12 year old level. I understand it is young adult but the writing was so simplified and the vocabulary was so poor that it was difficult to read. The characters were very hollow with none of the depth that the first two books had. A large chunk of the book involves Tris and Four sneaking off to be alone and make out, then they promise not to lie to each other anymore. This happens over and over again.The end of the second book is exciting. Many questions are asked. What is outside the city? How did Chicago become the way it is? Who is Beatrix Prior? The answers given seem to have been thrown together quickly without actually thinking about them. Tris and the gang are welcomed into the Bureau with no questions asked and Tris is even made a jr. council member. After that they just kind of forget about Chicago till the end of the book. Four becomes a terrorist and is caught only to be let free. The guards in the Bureau are horrible as they let Tris and anyone else talk to the prisoners whenever they want with no supervision.Then we have the serums. They have a serum for everything apparently and also an inoculation against them. My that is convenient. Don't forget Tris is immune to them also. Very convenient as well.So at the end of the book we find out that the Bureau is going to reset everyone in Chicago's memory to keep the experiment going. Tris decides this is wrong and that they must stop them. The only way to stop them she decides is to reset their memories. Because that makes perfect sense. Caleb for some reason is chosen to sacrifice his life and risk the dreaded death serum to release the memory reset serum. Then of course Tris doesn't let him do that and she goes off to release the memory serum.So Tris is exposed to the death serum and beats it surviving something no one else can do. How special of her. Mean while Four is off visiting back home for some reason. I really don't understand why Four and the others went back to Chicago is they were planning to stop the memory reset serum to be released in Chicago anyways.So Tris survives the death serum to find David guarding the memory reset serum in his wheelchair with a gun. Good thing for David he had the inoculation for the death serum. Tris releases the memory rest serum on the Bureau and David shoots her.Honestly if you didn't think Tris was going to die at the end of the books you weren't paying attention.

{"reviewTime": "10 29, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I absolutely adored the first two books in this series. I loved reading the storyline and also appreciated Tris' journey/growth as a character.I was super pumped for this book...I pre-ordered it through amazon and started reading the first day. Instantly, I was turned off. Not only does it keep switching from Tris to Tobias but the tone of each character was EXACTLY the same so I had to keep trying to remember which character this chapter belonged to.Now that they finally escaped the fence, I was really hoping for some meat in the plot but it turned out to be incredibly boring...the government shutting people away to weed out the genetically damaged people and produce genetically pure ones. Blah blah blah. I am so terribly confused by this whole story after that fact came out. Why would they shut them up with no control? Scientifically standing, this makes no sense...you need to have direction and involvement in this sort of program but it seems like it is just a bunch of government people watching the people in the fence all day. Really? If you are talking about genetically pure vs genetically damaged in the sense that the pure people did not have alterations done (blue eyes, blonde hair, etc), this would never work the way it is portrayed in the book. Everyone keeps breeding with everyone and eventually genes will sort themselves out again...but this could be happening inside or outside the fence.Also, the government compound is in...what, O'hare airport? Uh huh...right. And then you have the genetically damaged people living in the outskirts of chicago, again with no oversight. So, again, the damaged genes gets pushed all together, breeding with each other, never truly solving the problem. I am so confused! I felt like there was NO POINT to this entire story now. Nothing got accomplished...especially since this is going on all over the country!Now back to Tris and Tobias; they flat-lined as a couple. Throughout 75% of the book, they were awkward and weird with each other. They either couldn't stop arguing or they would kiss for a moment and say something cheesy before running away from each other. If you are going to throw in a love plot in a book, you need to commit to it so that it works in line with the whole series. This third book left me feeling like Tris and Tobias barely knew one another.Finally, Tris dying. One of the most pointless and unremarkable deaths I have read in a long time (this third book is on par with Twilight writing). She, of course, steps in to release the memory serum and she beats the death serum but ultimately is killed by the government's leader (in a wheelchair). And then, nothing happens. Vision going black, oh, I see my mom, time to die. There was no time taken to expand or revolt against what happens to Tris. Her brother was right there...plus all of her friends had been sneaking around for days getting things set up and no one is around to help or kill David or something.Another thing, all this security and no one notices all these kids whispering in broom closets with maps and whatever else...I wanted to beat my head against the wall.And Tobias's mother...after YEARS and YEARS of trying to become who she eventually became, she just gives it up in a less than 2 minute conversation. Willy nilly, no big deal. Easy peasy man. Let me just put down my gun cause my son wants me to and I will give it all up. Definitely not the same woman in book 2.This book seemed really rushed...not only rushed but a panicked rushed. 'I gotta write this third book to finish the series which has taken off...movies being made...' The author fell so far short of finishing this series well that I am surprised the book even has three stars.As I was reading, I would find myself looking for anything else to do beside read it...first time that has ever happened. I will finish anything but this was almost painful to keep reading. I was so disappointed. I hope they have some fan fiction come out for this series so I can read one of those endings instead to satisfy me.Boo, two thumbs down.Summary; book felt like it was written in a panicked, rushed state of mind.

{"reviewTime": "10 30, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "The pacing of the novel is really weird. Sometimes it seems like its going really slow, and that you&#8217;re learning a lot about what is going on, but nothing is really happening. Then all of a sudden, things seriously sped up and ended. So the pacing of the novel was incredibly awkward. I thought maybe the book could have been longer, or that the slower parts could be shorter and the action part longer. It seemed sort of weirdly balanced. Once the action started, it was so easy to finish the book, but the build up took a very long time.The Good:That all being said though, I really loved this book. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything because the book just came out a few days ago, and I don&#8217;t want to ruin it for anyone. I want to tell everyone what I think without ruining it for those who have not been able to read it yet, or who are catching up on the other books.I loved the direction that Veronica Roth took it in. The end of Insurgent leaves hanging with the idea of an outside world, that needs the Divergent. Which is so different than the city that Tris lives in, where the Divergent are hunted down. But when we finally see the outside world, its so different than what I had ever expected. What we learn and find out is incredible. Confusing, but incredible and it really explains so many plot holes that exist in the previous two books.I really liked the back and forth between Tris and Four. I feel like, its kind of become a habit for authors to do this dual point of view thing, especially for final books. It would normally kind of make me mad because of the repetitiveness but I really liked it. The only thing we&#8217;ve gotten of Four in the previous books is Tris&#8217;s own vision of him. Getting into his head, seeing his motives, his love for Tris, his fears, his hopes, all of that, really helps to carry the story. They clash all the time, and they both have such different fears and different backgrounds and it motivates their actions in different ways, and its also the way they come together.Some people had an issue with the end, and what happens there, and I&#8217;m going to try and say my thing without spoiling anything. I was immensely heartbroken by what happened at the end. It was incredibly unexpected and it ripped me to pieces. I spent a lot of time crying, which clouded up my glasses quite nicely. I think it makes the most sense, and that the way in which the events unfold seem so likely to me. In fact, before they unfolded, I was surprised at the direction that Veronica was taking the characters in. When things changed, and ended the way they did, it just made sense to me. The decisions that were made by the different characters just seemed to fit for each of them, and the ending was a full circle for the story. I think that Veronica took leaps and risks that some authors don&#8217;t do but I think it played out nicely for her.I&#8217;ve also not cried this hard with a book since I read the epilogue of Clockwork Princess.I don&#8217;t want to spoil much, because there is too much in this book to spoil for anyone but I loved it. I didn&#8217;t think it was perfect, because the pacing is just so weird, but I thought it was a beautiful, unexpected ending. People die, lives change, and I cried like crazy. Somehow my favorite character (I hope I never told you who that is&#8230;) survives but other characters that I love die. I think that there&#8217;s so much to learn and to still contemplate about their world and what could and will happen to everything and everyone. Its a beautiful book and I think Veronica leaves us with the same sort of bittersweet ending that JK Rowling leaves us with in Deathly Hallows.If you want a spoiler discussion, you can read it on my blog whatanerdgirlsays.com", "reviewerName": "What A Nerd Girl Says \"Book Blogger\"", "summary": "Spoiler Free, POSITIVE, honest review", "helpful": [1, 3], "overall": 4.0, "unixReviewTime": 1383091200, "reviewerID": "A2AP6O5EV0W6BT"}

If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with her work &#8211; you may be soon!  Divergent the movie is set to release in March.  I came across Divergent almost by accident after reading the Hunger Games trilogy and really enjoyed it but somehow lost track as each new book was being released so when I saw that Allegiant was out I put in on hold at the library and proceeded to wait about three months for it to come in.  This is the third book in the Divergent trilogy.Tris is once again imprisoned in the Erudite building awaiting her fate and contemplating the video released by Tobias (Four) at the end of the last book.  Tobias&#8217;s mother Evelyn the Factionless leader has taken over the city.  She forces everyone in the city to live as if they are factionless, gone are the clothing and traits that identify each faction; every person in the city must wear more than one color they must intermingle in their living quarters.  There is a contingent of rebels that wants to maintain factions however.  The factionless and faction rebels have several small skirmishes culminating in a large one at the over the bowls used at the Choosing Ceremony.  When the fight ends in death Tris accepts an invitation to a meeting of the rebel group.  In the meantime Tobias tell her that her brother Caleb has been sentenced to be executed in two weeks.  While unable to get beyond her brother&#8217;s betrayal that lead to her own near execution when she decides to leave the city with a group of rebels taking Caleb along is her one condition.Tris and a group of her friends escape the city losing Tori, to be found by someone Tobias thought was dead his former initiate instructor Amar.  They are taken to headquarters of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare at the former O&#8217;Hare airport, confirming for the reader that Tris&#8217;s city was indeed Chicago, just in case you weren&#8217;t sure because sometimes books like this take place in fictional places that just have similarities to our world.  At the Bureau they are told that the cities were an experiment.  Their goal is to get Divergent people, people with pure genes.This story moves fairly fast considering how long it is, and while I enjoyed it there were almost too many twists and turns for me.  The end shocked me, I never saw it coming.  Maybe I should have; I&#8217;m sure other readers did but not me.  It is a realistic ending though not entirely happy, such is life.

I am not sure if I would have given this book five stars had it not been for all the horrible one star reviews that this book does NOT deserve.Ok, the negatives first.This book has a different pace, tone, voice ( I don't know what exactly to call it ) than the other two books; not so much that it seems out of place but it is enough that when reading them together without a time gap that it is noticeable.  There is quite a lot of character death in this series which can be incredibly depressing.  Tris continually comes across as way more \"right\" than a sixteen year old girl should be.Now on to the positives.Typical books aimed at this demographic are horribly unrealistic and usually follow the exact same plot line over and over again.  They are written in such a way that the main character is supposed to be completely average in every single way yet somehow manages to steal the hearts of everyone with two of the most handsome men to ever grace this planet fight over her.  The girl is generally incapable of making the \"wrong\" choice.  Take Twilight for example:  The girl falls in love with her stalker who would like to eat her, lets another boy that she doesn't love take care of her while she is pretty much suicidal over the loss of the man who wants to eat her, then chooses an immortal life in which she doesn't have to give up her family, friends, the ability to have a child, or even have to suffer the desire to eat everyone who still possesses a heart beat.  Seriously, there are absolutely no consequences for her actions and that is how this genre tends to work.  I really do not think it is a good idea to keep filling teenage girls heads with that.  In this book Tris has to actually work at her relationship with Tobias.  They have issues and they fight but they also have to approach things in a mature way and work things out.  It isn't some fake soul mate crap that sets girls up for failure.  It is completely believable.  There are constant consequences for their actions.  News flash people, in real life there are good and bad things that happen based off of your actions and nonactions.  I love that both are addressed in this series.  I love that this series doesn't make it out like every person has to lead a poor sap on in order to determine if the girl actually loves the first guy or not.  I love that Tris went through a phase where she was putting herself in unnecessary danger and then she actually matures enough to realize that sometimes trudging into a situation head first is the wrong call.

I didn't read reviews because I didn't want the spoilers, but I did see that many people were disappointed regarding the ending. But I bought it anyways because I had been hooked on the series and I wanted to know what was coming next.*****SPOILER ALERT******Now I'm no fan of sad endings. When I read the end of  &#34;My Sister's Keeper,&#34; I literally threw the book across the room- I was that mad. That ending seemed to be pointless- and Hollywood must have recognized that since they changed it for the movie.(Now I have a Kindle and cannot throw books across the room- one shortcoming of digitized reading material!)Anyways....I had loved the first two installments of the series, reading each in a matter of hours. When I wasn't reading, I was thinking about the story line and wondering what was coming next.Allegiant uses a dual narrative and I sometimes had to back up to the beginning of a chapter to see whose voice I was reading. Not because the narratives were that similar, but because they were discussing people or scenarios that they were both familiar with.One review said the narrative of Tobias made him sound like a &#34;15 year old girl.&#34; I disagree. Tobias had always represented strength to Tris and to the readers. It was interesting to see that he was much more vulnerable then he had previously portrayed himself to be.Tris comes into her own in Allegiant. I suspected that she was much more cunning and insightful than in previous situations and it seems the character begins to trust herself and became much more confident. All three of her possible faction choices come in to play regarding her decisions which I thought was a nice touch.The genetic component seemed to me to be an substitute for race. That's what I took away from it. I mean seriously, how different is &#34;genetically pure&#34; from &#34;racially pure?&#34;  They're basically one and the same. Especially when you find out that those who are &#34;genetically damaged&#34; are treated much differently than those who are &#34;genetically pure.&#34; The GD receive harsher penalties for crimes and little or no government assistance.The ending did not surprise me. I felt that Tris had been leading us to a point where she would ultimately sacrifice herself for the greater good. That was her journey.Some readers thought hers to be a pointless sacrifice. I disagree. From her childhood in Abnegation, she had been taught about sacrifice. That lesson remained with her as she rejected that faction and essentially tried to develop herself into a person who valued self over anything else.At the end it seems she embraces her truth, that she believed in self-sacrifice. When she was about to die in &#34;Insurgent,&#34; her inner monologue screams that she doesn't want to die. At the end of Allegiant though, she recognizes that her death is necessary and she welcomes it.In summation, I loved this series. The death of the lead character was extremely sad but was also fitting. Tris had led the reader on this journey to the very end. Her death did have meaning and it changed everything- the epilogue proves that.Tris displayed a character trait, deep empathy, that I wish a lot of real people had. Tris felt for those who struggled and did what she could, and had to do, to make her world a better place.Not every story has a &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending, especially in reality. I think this is why most readers crave that from literature. We want black and white, every plot and sub-plot tied up with a neat little bow. We want that because it rarely happens in real life. I myself also love it when stories end that way.But this series could not deliver that package. If it had, it would not have been so poignant. If it had, some one out there would be bound to complain anyways.I have recommended this series to all of my friends.

I read Ms. Roth's statement about why before reading the book and went into it wanting to know what led to this finale... Was it at least a good story leading up to the devastating ending.  The answer to that is yes, it was a good story and the motivation behind Tris' sacrifice was clear.  She really did come full circle and the author does a good job showing her growth and maturity.  However, the ending just didn't serve any purpose.  Yes, we get she couldn't let Caleb die, yes she followed in her parents footsteps, but what was the point?  Especially after she survived the death serum, found out David did indeed love her mother, and then only to be shot?!?!  I mean come on, how lame can you get?? So many other things could have happened and she picked the worst and lamest way to go.  If she didn't want to go for shock value then she shouldn't have included all the tear jerkers either... Looking into Tobias' eyes, planning a future together, finally having a reason to want to live through the good, bad, and ugly.  Knowing the ending definitely made me more aware of these lines and it was just an attempt to go straight to the heartstrings..

Insurgent I read with real interest, if not with the same fascination I found while reading the first book.  Allegiant began slowly.  My interest flagged and I had to push myself to stay with it.  I found the fluctuating point of view writing mechanic confusing and tedious.That said, the pace picked up when our heroes make it to the Bureau.

I hate spoilers so I won't provide any here.  However, those of you who are angry, remember that Tris was raised Abnegation.  Her earliest teachings were from that venue.  She idolized her parents for their selflessness even as she chose Dauntless as her faction.  Tobias too carries those early teachings in his psyche and those teachings were a force in each of their choices.I can't second guess the author, but I think Ms. Roth was demonstrating that upbringing and teachings, rather than genetic structure, are critical in any discussion of choices and behavior.  Science has llong questioned whether background or genetics is the primary motivating factor.  My theory is that the author tried to demonstrate that a genetic pre-disposition to leap into danger when necessary was tempered by those initials teachings of selflessness.

{"reviewTime": "10 25, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "I didn't hate this book, as many other reviewers did.  It was by far the weakest of the series (including the short stories), but there were parts I liked.  It also had some of the same \"I can't stop reading\" feel that the others had.  However, it left me with a tremendous feeling of loss, and I didn't personally gain enough from it to make up for that, so I'd suggest thinking twice before reading it.In particular, if you love Tobias, and especially if you love the relationship between him and Tris, please let yourself be happy with the first two books, the short stories, and fan-fiction.  Let your imagination fill in the rest to give them the ending you feel they deserve.  You won't get enough new romance out of this book to make up for what it will do to you.Also, if you only kind of liked the first two books, save your money and skip this one.  It's not as good.The rest of you might want to read it, despite its flaws.  It does wrap up the story, and the ending is powerful -- not pleasant, but powerful.  To help you decide, here's a summary of what works and what doesn't...What works:1. You learn more about Tris' mother.  It's not as interesting as it should be, but it's there.2. You find out what happened to some characters who were mentioned earlier but not shown.3. You get the story on the world around Chicago, why they're there, and how they came to be.4. There are some good scenes.  I didn't find any of them exciting enough to bookmark the first time through, but I did go back and re-read four scenes after finishing the book, and I've found myself thinking about some of the others.5. It explores concepts you don't often see in YA books -- remorse, change, death, healing, and everyday forms of courage.  In particular, though the end is crushingly sad, you realize that some of the characters improved each others' lives permanently and changed the world around them for the better, and that this effect doesn't go away when they die.  Basically, their lives and relationships were worthwhile, even if much too short.What doesn't work:1. The book lacks emotion.  \"Divergent\" and \"Insurgent\" have a lot of feeling, both stated and implied.  There are many scenes in those books that I re-read repeatedly, just savoring the feel of them.  This book has very, very little of that, and what it does have isn't as good.  The only feeling that's deep is grief, which is overwhelming at the end, but honestly, most of that grief is because you love the characters from how they were in the earlier books, not for what you saw in this book.2. The narration never finds its groove and doesn't sound like it did in earlier stories.  Tris's sentence structure is suddenly short, with no \"poetry\" to the words, and Tobias/Four doesn't sound at all like he did in the short stories.  Also, they sound so much like each other that I kept forgetting whose POV I was reading.3. Most of the other characters disappear or die without any further development.  They have very few lines, and some of them (including some important ones) literally die without ever speaking a new word.4. The whole faction concept, with all of its interesting elements, basically just goes away.5. The characters are under-developed.  Personally, I thought there were subtle clues in the earlier books about some of them, and I expected to see Roth pick up on those clues the way JK Rowling always did, but absolutely none of them came back that way.  As an example, Tori got through Jeanine's defenses, implying she was Divergent, yet we saw her kill an Abnegation leader during the simulation, implying she wasn't.  I thought we'd learn more about her, but she doesn't speak a single word in this book.  I expected some big reveals about Caleb and Peter, but that didn't happen either.  Uriah, one of the more interesting side characters, says almost nothing.  The same goes with Evelyn, and the relationship between her and Natalie Prior, and Marcus, and really all of them -- those clues are all left as loose strings.6. The plot is simplistic and full of holes.  The earlier two books had a lot of action and unexpected twists and turns.  This one doesn't.* Warning: The rest of this review contains major spoilers. *To me, the biggest disappointment with Tris wasn't her death.  That was actually the most in-character part of the book.  What frustrated me was how she got there.  She finds out that people are going to wipe memories, and she immediately plans to wipe their memories instead, without even trying to think of any other solutions?  She doesn't offer to go into the city and fix things another way to avoid the need for the reset (you know, like her mother did)?  She doesn't try using her influence on David to get him to see another perspective?  She doesn't kidnap him and take him into the city?  She doesn't use the memory wipe serum directly on him?  No, she jumps straight to the idea of setting off the serum en masse.  And then, after she decides that, she can only think of one way to get it?  She doesn't try to figure out the passcode, even though Tobias is great with computers and even though David was obsessed with her mother and maybe used her name as a passcode?  She doesn't consider attacking the group that's taking the serum to the plane - you know, releasing the serum by shooting the container it's in?  Instead, she just states that it's a suicide mission and lets her brother agree to die for it.  It's so glaringly out of character that I assumed Roth was going to have a bunch of other things happen to change this course of action, but she didn't.Also, I have to ask... after everything Tobias has been through in his life, how could that be the ending that Roth felt he deserved?  Tris was the only bright spot in his very dark life, and he lost her.  She accepted her fate and was glad to go to her mother, so I don't feel as bad for her, but it just feels blatantly unfair to Tobias.  What was the point of doing that to him?  To me, it ruined the idea of this as a romance book.", "reviewerName": "Windchimed", "summary": "If you love Tris and Tobias, think twice before reading this book", "helpful": [83, 90], "overall": 3.0, "unixReviewTime": 1382659200, "reviewerID": "ARY7NTZL1EBI3"}

{"reviewTime": "11 26, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying, I loved Divergent. It was unique, intense, introduced great characters, and had phenomenal world building. Insurgent was really good, but I felt like it was missing the spark that was Divergent. I don't know what was missing. I speculated that it was Tris and Four - their relationship was this amazing building block in Divergent and had become not necessarily an obstacle but they weren't always beside one another. Insurgent pushed the envelope in terms of their relationship, in many ways putting them at odds and making you miss what they had. It's probably why I'd give Insurgent 4 stars and Divergent 5 stars.So, with high hopes I purchased a copy of Allegiant. There's something about trilogies and lately I feel like they're hit or misses. The author has created this grand story, with characters you've invested in emotionally. Unlike a single book on its own, you read it for a few days or a week, put it down and are done. Series have a way of capturing you long term. You read the first book. You fall for the characters, the story, the plot and pacing. You become a part of the adventure. Each book is like unlocking a secret into a world you want to know more about. You're given only pieces of the story in the series and it's the final book that you expect answers, and in many cases hope for a happy ending.The first part of this review for Allegiant will be spoiler free. I will have a warning for when I explain the details of my rating.I commend Roth for taking a chance with using both Tris and Four's voice for alternating chapters. It was something the readers looked forward to. I feared it and will explain why beneath where spoilers are below.I felt the pacing in Allegiant was off. I read it, I turned the page, I put the book down. I read Divergent in three days. It took me ten days to read Allegiant. At least one, if not two of those nights I deliberately chose not to read the book. I needed a break from it. There wasn't enough action and when it was integrated into the plot, it didn't flow like Divergent had. Maybe I remember Divergent different then it was. Maybe I've put the book high on a pedestal and Allegiant could never compare. Personally, I don't think that's the case. I just felt bored by the story. I also felt some of the explanations (Divergent and what it means) ruined the series for me. The pieces of the puzzle (Divergent & Insurgent) when put together and given a full explanation consisted of disappointment (Allegiant).SPOILERS BELOWSo here's the thing. I've read other trilogies lately, Dystopian and felt the endings fell flat. For example, Lauren Oliver's Requiem (Delirium 3). I loved the first two books in her series. The third book felt like a cop out. She has a love triangle with two guys and doesn't give us an actual ending. It's the final book. We want everything spelled out for us, happy ending and all, including what happens to everyone. No such luck. I loved Mockingjay's ending for The Hunger Games. I know there are others out there that hated it but of all the dystopian endings lately, that has been the best I've read. The  I suppose it's how it's done, unraveling the story and still keeping certain elements alive.Here's my issue with Allegiant. It wasn't just a sad ending. It felt like part of it was unnecessary. Tris risks her life, knowing she is doing it to save her brother that betrayed her. I read the reasoning, I understand it. I can even accept that she went in to do the mission. Okay. She struggled but survived. What I thought sucked, yes this is how I felt, was that after everything she got shot. I'd have rather her died from the poison. I felt like being shot was so blah. Like - this is how she died? She's this big, bad ass chick that we've fallen in love with and she's dead from a friggin' bullet. Maybe I expect too much. If she's going to die, it should be bigger, bolder.Okay next, Tris and Four's point of view. I loved the idea that we'd finally feel and experience things from Four's perspective. I was a little nervous though. If only for the fact that let's face it - in first person point of view - the person telling the story can't die. If they're telling the story, they make it to the end, they're safe. (Unless you're reading a diary style novel). Now the author brings in Four's POV. The initial fan reaction was YAY! I felt that too, until I realized it means, Tris is very much at risk for dying. Could Tobias/Four be killed off? Sure, but then it would have remained in Tris' point of view. So, from the beginning I knew the basic fact for the ending. Plus, with the fan reaction of OMG horrible ending, it was quick to realize that it was probably fact. All that aside, my actual opinion on the point of view switch is that the intent was good, the execution fell flat to me. The chapters didn't feel different upon reading them. I also didn't feel like Four was the character we met in Divergent. The toughness to him had melted away, and not in an enjoyable way. I half-wonder if the books issues are a result of the movie being constructed. Authors have a character in their head. Then when the movie is being produced, seeing a new version of a character (and with a director that may have a different vision than what you had), it's possible your own perception shifts while writing the novel. It may be something you don't even notice doing, or perhaps I just felt like Tobias was out of character in his dialogue and thoughts.Why do I feel this way? For example we learn what Divergent actually means. Tobias gets super emotional over it. Don't get me wrong, the initial shock would probably bother most people. Dauntless are taught to be tough. Tobias has been strong in the first two novels. To see him come so easily undone by people that you don't know, truths you're told that you wonder if they're actually real, it was a mess to me. Which leads to..Too much of the book focused on Genetically Pure and Genetically Damaged. The whole meaning of Divergent, the cool aspect of what these people were disappeared. The spark that had been created in the first book, fizzled out. For example, online we choose factions based on the books. It's fun, it's a way to connect with readers, and it's also a way to show what we think of ourselves. Veronica Roth did amazing in creating these factions. The factions themselves, the initial idea was smart. Readers connected with it. I felt the unfolding of it in Allegiant wasn't done well. Maybe it was the explanation itself that I didn't like. It all being an experiment, Divergent's are Genetically Pure and everyone else is Genetically Damaged. Too much of the book focused on this and it was something that I understood, but didn't connect with. When reading it on my Kindle - I noticed that at 80% the story kicked up a notch. I felt like we finally had the action that I'd been missing. Veronica Roth writes action well. I missed it in Allegiant.Would I recommend Allegiant? If you've read, Divergent, then you're likely going to want to finish the series and know what happens to the characters. Will I read another book by Veronica Roth? Honestly, I don't know. I don't like investing in characters and not liking the final book. It doesn't need to be a best seller, but I do need to feel like my time wasn't wasted and that the author cares about the characters too. That aside, I'm not a fan of unhappy endings, unless I'm reading a Contemporary novel (stand-alone, not a series). I think if you're investing in the time it takes to read a series, then readers are going to expect an ending they want for the characters they love. Otherwise, you're taking a chance at antagonizing the audience.

Tris and Four had been set up to be unique characters, but then when Roth uses both as first-person POV in this book instead of just Tris, it weakens the characters instead of strengthening them.

Really, if I'd known that unnecessary death would be the major emphasis for this book's ending (and really the whole series) I would never have bothered with it in the first place.  I have to add that a lot of my disgust stems from the TOTAL lack of closure or even the need for Tris' death in the first place.  (I'll add Will, Uriah, Tory, Natalie Prior to that as well.)And, really, killing off the young girl who's blossoming into our strong heroine - is that what Ms. Roth wants young girls to be left with???  That young ladies who aspire to greater things, who struggle to grow into better humans, who become brave and self-sacrificing - should let themselves be done away with?  That's really disconcerting.Also:  Why bother bringing up how good a leader Four could be and then he does nothing of the sort?  At the end, we find him as an assistant - assistant?!?! - to Johanna who's now in some governmental position.  Whaaaaaat....All I'm left with is a total sense of disillusionment and I am disgusted with the ending.  Save your reading time for something better; say The 5th Wave, Stung or Chanur's Saga.  Don't waste your time on this one.Edited 01/09/14A few things that have been nagging me since I posted this review:One:  Uriah's demise is completely glossed over.  For the whole second book (Insurgent) we are dragged on and on and on and on over Will's death.  But come this third book and, oh, you know, it's only Uriah; he is killed off and forgotten in about six pages.  Wow.  It completely fails the character that Ms. Roth built to become Uriah.  Oh, let's vilify Tris and give her depression over Will, but have Tobias say 'oh, sorry' and dismiss his actions that lead to Uriah's death.  How hypocritical on the author's part!Second:  What in the world are Divergent/Dauntless doing using flashlights while on a clandestine mission to exit the city at night???  Um, we're talking about Four, Tory, Uriah and Tris, who've all moved around in the dark previous to this without lights.  What gives?  Oh, wait - it's an easy way to kill off characters!  Of course!  I totally thought that we were getting a real story - my bad.  Hey, want to get rid of Tory?  Have her use a flashlight in the dark when she's approaching the fence, knowing that the Factionless all have weapons and that Evelyn doesn't want anyone to leave.  Bang, bang!  Okay, that character is taken care of!  That was really, really, REALLY hard to buy into.  I think it was actually easier for me to buy into Tris' death than Tory's.Third:  Since the Bureau can 'see all' in the city and clearly has easy access to all the data in the city, I found it very implausible that they could be indicted for having come up with the 'simulation serum' and then passing it onto Jeannine Matthews.  They could just as easily copied the formula from her equations and duplicated it themselves.  So how does a vial of it in a filing cabinet in some back room storage PROVE that they gave it to Jeannine???Again, save yourself; read the 5th Wave instead.

{"reviewTime": "12 3, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "[...]I've come to the conclusion that there's something about dystopian trilogies that inevitably lead to the same conclusion: The existing government is overthrown by the rebel-led insurrection, but something always is amiss. Maybe it's just me, but the finales for a lot of dystopian trilogies tend to fall flat (Ally Condie's \"Matched\" series comes to mind here), and leave you feeling a little disappointed at how an exciting beginning can end almost lifelessly. \"Allegiant\", the third and final book to Veronica Roth's riveting \"Divergent\" trilogy, left me feeling that way, bringing what could've been an unputdownable series to close.The world as Tris knows it has disappeared. The factions have been abolished, fractured by betrayal and violence and replaced instead by a new, problematic society led by Tobias' mother, Evelyn. So when she is offered a chance to explore the world beyond the fence, a world in which she and Tobias can find a simple new life together, Tris is more than ready to go. But when she discovers that her new reality is even more disturbing than the one she's left behind, with secrets that force her to examine her loyalties and discoveries that change the hearts of those she loves. Once again, Tris must fight to comprehend the complexities of human nature--and of herself--while facing impossible choices of courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.I know my introductory paragraph up there hardly left any room for optimism, but trust me when I say that \"Allegiant\" isn't a crappy book. In fact, Tris and Tobias' character developments were interesting to read about as the book progressed, especially since it is the final book in the trilogy, which means that they will soon reach the crux of their character journeys before the last page. Tris, to me, is an awesome heroine. Not only is she a brave, butt-kicking and stubborn protagonist, but she is also compassionate and thoughtful, which, I guess, is the whole point of her role as a Divergent: Tris is an amalgamation of all these different characteristics which make each and every one of us human, from erudition, dauntlessness, abnegation, candor and amity (see what I did there). Watching her as she deals with conflicting problems and new, life-changing discoveries, as well as with her relationships with her family, friends, and Tobias, reveals the huge amount of change she's gone through since the beginning of the series. Tris is, without a doubt, a great heroine you can't help but become invested in and root for from the start, and I'd even go so far as to say one that you can look up to as a sort of role model.The same, unfortunately, can't really be said about Tobias. If Tris is the epitome of a teenaged heroine, then Tobias is more of a gritty, 'real' character, with possibly more faults than admirable traits. I understand that growing up, Tobias had to deal with a butt ton of issues that left a lot of emotional, mental and physical scars, but there were times when I just felt like he was kind of annoying. This might be because of the comparison between his perspective and Tris', since the chapters alternated between their two points of view. There was definitely a sort of emotional journey that he goes through, what with his mother and abusive father and Tris and so on, but I still felt like he ended up as a character I lost interest in. On the other hand, he and Tris were generally pretty sweet as a couple, with a strong and believable dynamic between them that allowed them to mature both individually and as a pair. I just wish Tobias himself was a little more likable and strong as a character, especially since he was pretty great in the first two books!The real disappointment I felt toward \"Allegiant\" was about its plot. It seemed as if the real action was over in the second book, and \"Allegiant\" just dragged it on for the sake of having a third book in the trilogy. Like I said before, the storyline is pretty generic for a dystopian finale, where there are post-insurrection problems that make the characters realize that everything is not as they seem. The pace was pretty plodding throughout the entire novel, and there wasn't much of a climax either. In a way, it's kind of like the storyline meanders this way and that, and never skyrocketed in tension or excitement. This may be due to the fact that Ms. Roth was trying to tie up all of the loose ends from previous books, in terms of Tobias' family and Tris' struggles with Caleb and being Divergent, but it ultimately fell flat.All in all, \"Allegiant\" is a pretty disappointing finale to what had been an exciting and refreshing dystopian trilogy. It's unfortunate to see such great world-building, strong characters and riveting storylines decline to a dull end, as much as I (really, really, really!) don't want to say it.Rating: 2/5", "reviewerName": "Yoon-Ji", "summary": "A finale that falls flat", "helpful": [5, 5], "overall": 2.0, "unixReviewTime": 1386028800, "reviewerID": "A77GBHHVGUBXT"}

{"reviewTime": "11 7, 2013", "asin": "0007444117", "reviewText": "Veronica Roth completes her Divergent Trilogy with a shocking, well plotted, consistent, rather long installment that has Tris and Tobias venturing out of the only world they have known and being awakened to what is really going on.  Ms. Roth, as has been true for the previous two installments in this (rightfully so) best-selling Young Adult series, pulls no punches and gives the reader no reason to expect the future to be much different from the world inhabited at present.  There is much good around each of us, an equaling amount of cause for alarm and each person must make choices that will lead them onto paths that will define the next choice offered them.After the &#8220;purging&#8221; that ended the Insurgent section of the series, the Factions are disbanded, leadership is returning to the tyrannical practices &#8220;of the previous administration,&#8221; and everyone, it seems, are living with rules that are shadowy and constantly in flux.  Tris, having been branded a traitor because of her actions in the insurrection, must face questioning, after been given Truth Serum, to determine her fate. As a result of her being &#8220;divergent,&#8221; she is able to withstand the effects of the serum and is given a sentence that gives her to opportunity to escape and fulfill Edith Prior&#8217;s directive of &#8220;helping us outside the fence.&#8221;  Tobias, son of the new leader of the City, surrenders his position to join the Allegiant, a group who want to overthrow the present regime and return to life as it was and also to escape to the world beyond the boundaries of the only reality he has ever known.Similar to Plato&#8217;s cave analogy, what this group (of six, including our heroes) discovers when they arrive at their destination is a shock, discovering that what they &#8220;knew&#8221; to be true was but a illusion meant to keep them entertained until they discovered they were only looking at shadows.  This is but the first incident of being confronted with truth that was not True.  With each new revelation, each person must assess the information, choose what to believe and take action.  There are changes that must be made and difficult selections to face by all.  Late in the book Tobias gives definition to the trilogy, &#8220;Sometimes, all it takes to save people from a terrible fate is one person willing to do something about it&#8221; (p.438).The story is a bit draggy for the first third to half of its length (better editing would have improved the book tremendously) but once it starts rolling, the reader is often left breathless in an effort to keep pace with its cadence. There is harsh language that is surprising for younger readers, and occasional &#8220;romantic&#8221; moments that are warm, but never cross into &#8220;hot.&#8221; Told from the alternate, first person perspectives of Tris and Tobias, the book proffers the reader viewpoints that are often at odds but whose tension is the foundational element of the series.  In order to understand the majority of this book, the reader must have read the previous two volumes in the trilogy.Ms. Roth is brave in her ending the trilogy as she did.  It would have been just as easy to have all the heroes walking in a world that is clean, orderly and without conflict. To have done so would have been to lessen the impact of the trilogy.  It has been honest, offering a realistic assessment of the world, demanding in its assessment that not all good choices end with the reward expected or merited but that does not make the choice any less needed or correct.  Difficult conflict will occur and be resolved; life will offer new conflicts just as difficult tomorrow.  Living requires that we: work hard, laugh, make connections, watch those connections be suddenly severed, go make new relationships just as vital, rise each morning with the knowledge that&#8220;Life damages us, everyone. We can&#8217;t escape that damage.But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended.
